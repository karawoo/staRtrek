Today we begin prayer and meditation as preparation for our Days of
Atonement. May the Prophets walk with us as we begin our journey. <br>

and sits. The lamp sends a beam of light out to each monk, then five go

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Have you been taking your makara herbs? <br>
KIRA: Absolutely. Mostly. <br>
BASHIR: Kira, you have to take them. Your progesterone levels are way
too low. <br>
KIRA: But if I take the herbs, then the sedatives you gave me don't
work. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, the herbs do act as a counteragent, but I thought you said
you weren't having any trouble sleeping and that you didn't need any
sedatives? <br>
KIRA: I don't. But Julian, those herbs taste like something that
crawled out of Quark's ear. <br>
BASHIR: Just take them. <br>
KIRA: All right. <br>
ODO: Major, may I have a word with you? <br>
BASHIR: We're finished here. <br>
KIRA: Sure. <br>
(Bashir leaves.) <br>
ODO: I'm afraid I have bad news. One of the former members of your
resistance cell has been killed on Bajor. Latha Mabrin. <br>
KIRA: How? <br>
ODO: It appears a small hunter probe was hidden inside a ceremonial
candle and fired a disruptor blast. <br>
KIRA: Do they have any suspects? <br>
ODO: Too many. Before he became a Vedek, your friend was involved in
some very questionable activities. <br>
KIRA: Latha was a violent man, but then he found the Prophets, and the
last time I talked to him, he'd changed, really changed. <br>
ODO: I don't doubt that, Major. But it would appear that the violence
of his past finally has caught up with him. <br>
KIRA: Let me know if you hear anything else. <br>
ODO: Of course.

ODO: As you might have guessed, there's no point of origin listed in
the computer log. <br>
SISKO: When did we receive this message? <br>
KIRA: It came over the primary subspace antenna at thirteen forty one
hours. Almost the same moment Latha was killed on Bajor. <br>
SISKO: And you think that this is a threat against all the former
members of the Shakaar resistance cell? <br>
ODO: That's my working theory, but I'm not ruling anything out. <br>
SISKO: Did anyone else receive this message? <br>
KIRA: Not that we know of. So obviously there's some connection to me,
but I don't know what it is. I haven't even spoken to Latha in two
years. <br>
ODO: I'm waiting for the preliminary crime scene report from the
authorities on Bajor before I begin my own investigation. But I'd like
to increase security here on the station and initiate random checks on
all incoming cargo. <br>
SISKO: Agreed. <br>
KIRA: I've contacted most of the surviving members of the Shakaar and
warned them to take precautions, just in case. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry about your friend. <br>
KIRA: He died serving the Prophets. They'll take care of him. <br>

O'BRIEN: I know. I heard you pacing all night. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry. <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't be. I would've gotten up and kept you company, but I
figured you wanted to be alone. <br>
KIRA: I couldn't stop thinking about Latha. All those fire fights and
bombings he lived through just to be killed during a religious
ceremony. You know, if I wasn't pregnant I would be down on Bajor right
now trying to narrow down the suspects. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're safer on the station. <br>
KIRA: That's what's driving me crazy. I'm sitting here eating breakfast
while someone may be hunting down my friends. I'm a Major in the
Bajoran militia. I should be down there trying to protect them. <br>
O'BRIEN: Right now you're needed here, protecting someone else. <br>
KIRA: Yeah, right. I guess I do have my hands full at the moment. <br>

phase-divergent carrier wave. Try to keep them talking. <br>
KIRA: This is Major Kira Nerys. Who am I speaking to? <br>
FALA [on monitor]: Nerys? Is that really you? <br>
KIRA: Fala? <br>
FALA: Are you alone? I don't want anyone to hear me. I think, I think
someone's trying to trace my signal. <br>
KIRA [on monitor]: Stand by. She's a friend. Her name's Trentin Fala. <br>
SISKO: One of the members of your cell? <br>
KIRA: No. <br>
ODO: Then why is she hiding her location? <br>
KIRA: I'd rather not talk about it here, but trust me, she's no threat
to anyone. Let me talk to her alone and see what's going on. <br>
(Kira goes to an upper level console.) <br>
KIRA: I'm alone, and no one here will trace your signal. <br>
FALA [on monitor]: You heard about Latha? They killed him. As he knelt
in prayer, they killed him! <br>
KIRA: I know. And the authorities are investigating that right now. <br>
FALA [on monitor]: They're going to kill me too, Nerys. They've been
watching me. <br>
KIRA: Who's been watching you? <br>
FALA [on monitor]: I don't know, but I feel it. I need to get out of
here, go somewhere safe. Please, Nerys, you've got to help me. You
always promised that you'd help. <br>
KIRA: All right, calm down. I'll protect you. You can stay here at the
station until all of this is over. Two of our officers are returning
this afternoon from Starbase sixty three. I'll reroute them to Bajor
and have them pick you up. Okay? <br>
FALA [on monitor]: Okay. <br>
KIRA: Their names are Worf and Jadzia Dax. They'll contact with you
within the hour. <br>
FALA [on monitor]: I knew I could count on you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: You've been smirking ever since we left the
Starbase. <br>
WORF: I do not smirk. But if I did this would be a good occasion. <br>
DAX: How was I supposed to know that Captain Ramirez was a three-time
tongo champion? <br>
WORF: You might have asked before mocking him and then allowing him to
up the stakes to a no-limit game. <br>
DAX: I didn't lose that much. <br>
WORF: Two bars of latinum. I hope you have it. <br>
DAX: I have it. Most of it. Worf? <br>
WORF: No. <br>
DAX: Fine. I'll borrow it from Quark. He likes me. <br>
WORF: Major Kira's friend is ready for transport. Quark may lend you
the money, but remember Rule of Acquisition number one hundred and
eleven. Treat people in your debt like family, exploit them. <br>
DAX: You know the Rules of Acquisition? <br>
WORF: I am a graduate of Starfleet Academy. I know many things. <br>
DAX: Energising. <br>
(Fala starts to beam in then her image begins to warp) <br>
DAX: There's a power surge in the buffer! <br>
WORF: Something is interfering with the integration matrix. <br>
DAX: I'm transferring her pattern to the secondary buffer. <br>
WORF: Boost the gain on the energising coils. <br>
DAX: It won't go any higher. I'm losing her! <br>
(Fala writhes in the beam, and a smoking corpse finally solidifies.) <br>
(Later, docked at the station, Sisko and Odo watch as Bashir and a
medic scan the remains. Kira enters.) <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, Nerys. <br>
KIRA: I'm hearing that a lot lately. Can I have a moment? <br>
BASHIR: Of course. <br>
(Kira picks up Fala's earring.) <br>
SISKO: I wish there was something I could say, Major. <br>
KIRA: Just tell me it was an accident. <br>
SISKO: The Constable thinks otherwise. <br>
ODO: I believe she was killed by a remat detonator. It's a device
programmed to scramble a transporter beam during rematerialisation.
They're typically no more than two cubic millimetres in size. It could
have been hidden in her clothing or injected into her skin. <br>
WORF: The device is typically used by the Romulans. However, it is sold
on the black market. <br>
KIRA: Why didn't the transporter security system detect the device? <br>
DAX: We're not sure. The system is programmed to scan for remats, so
whoever did this has a sophisticated understanding of our security
protocols. <br>
KIRA: And a vendetta against the Shakaar resistance cell. <br>
SISKO: I thought you said that Trentin Fala wasn't a member of the
Shakaar. <br>
KIRA: She wasn't, at least not officially. Fala spent the occupation
cleaning floors in a Cardassian records office in Dahkur Province. She
passed us information for years without anyone catching on. But she was
always so afraid. Afraid that she'd be caught and executed. But she
never stopped. I once told her that I thought she was braver than all
of us, because she had to live with her fear every day. Even after the
occupation was over, she didn't want anyone to know that she was
secretly helping us. She was worried that someone would come looking
for her for revenge. <br>
SISKO: Looks like her fears were well founded.

QUARK: Hello, Major. I was just about to call you. <br>
KIRA: Quark, what is that? <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Since she was an informant, it stands to
reason that Fala was killed because she was providing information to
the resistance. Information that the Shakaar used to plan an attack on
a Cardassian target. The killer is probably someone who was either
injured or who lost a family member or a friend in that attack. <br>
KIRA: We planned dozens of attacks based on Fala's information. It
could be any of them. <br>
ODO: Not any. We're dealing with an operation in which you played a
prominent part. Now perhaps you could make a list of all the attacks by
the Shakaar that you participated in? <br>

Maybe it's not too late. Are you all right? <br>
KIRA: No, I'm not all right! I haven't slept in three days, someone is
killing my friends, and my back! Sorry. <br>
ODO: No apology necessary, Major. They haven't been able to contact
Mobara, so they're sending a search party to the university right now.
They'll let us know what happens. Major, if I may make a suggestion?
Why don't you return to your quarters and rest for now? It may be
several hours before they're able to make a complete search. <br>

somebody moving around in here. I thought it was you <br>

Times have changed. We have got to change with it. Leave this for the
authorities. <br>
FUREL: Authorities. <br>
LUPAZA: Maybe you feel that way now, but trust me, when you find out
who killed Latha and Fala, and maybe now Mobara, you're not going to
want to leave it to someone else. You're going to want him dead and
you're going to want us to do it. <br>

behind his right ear. <br>
SISKO: How could someone get close enough to implant something behind
someone's ear and not get caught? <br>
ODO: I doubt he was ever near Mobara. The killer's shown a pattern of
using remote-controlled devices. He was probably using some kind of
hunter probe and injected Mobara as he slept. <br>
SISKO: What are we dealing with here, a professional assassin? <br>

be sending anonymous messages. No, our killer is someone with a very

made some kind of joke. I don't remember what it was, but I do remember
that Lupaza hit him. She was always doing that. They loved each other
in some way. But it was up to Shakaar and he stared at me for a long
time before he decided I was big enough to carry a phaser rifle after
all. So we set up the ambush up along a ridgeline that night and
waited. It was so cold my hands were shaking. I was so afraid that one
of them would look at me and think that I was nervous, that I kept
biting my fingers to keep the blood flowing. We must have waited there
three or four hours before the skimmer appeared and set down right
where Furel said it would. And when that hatch opened and that first
Cardassian stepped out, I just started firing. And I didn't stop till
I'd discharged the entire power cell. When it was all over, I was so
relieved that I didn't let anyone down that I was almost giddy. Furel
kept telling me to stop grinning, that it made me look younger, but I
couldn't help it. I was one of them. I was in the Resistance. Lupaza
made me this (her earring) out of some of the metal from that skimmer.
How were they killed? <br>
ODO: Someone attached a small hunter probe to the hull of a Talavian
freighter. When the ship docked at the station, the probe detached
itself and then began a visual scan of every room in the Habitat ring.
Once the probe found its assigned targets, it attached itself to the
window and exploded. <br>
KIRA: Do you have any leads? <br>
ODO: My sources on Cardassia have given me a list of possible suspects.
They all have the computer skills, the opportunity and the motive to
carry out these attacks. <br>
KIRA: You must have called in a lot of favours. <br>
ODO: One or two. <br>
KIRA: How many people are on the list now? <br>
ODO: Twenty five. <br>
KIRA: Can I see it? <br>
ODO: Not just yet. I'd like to narrow it a little. <br>
KIRA: You're afraid I'm going to take the names and go charging off
after them. <br>
ODO: Something like that. <br>
KIRA: You're right. I probably would. <br>
ODO: I'm going to find the person that's done this. I promise you that.
<br>
KIRA: I know you will, Odo. Keep me informed. <br>
ODO: Absolutely. <br>
(Odo leaves. Kira gets up and goes to a console.) <br>
COMPUTER: Emergency transport standing by. Enter command code
authorisation. <br>
KIRA: Authorisation Kira one five seven alpha. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: She's obviously going after the suspects on
the list, but she erased the names from my computer file when she got
them so there's no way to know where she's headed. <br>
SISKO: Prepare the Defiant. I want to leave in ten minutes. See if we
can pick up her ion trail. <br>
WORF: It will be difficult. Our sensor logs show that Major Kira masked
her engine emissions with a polaron field. The runabout's particle <br>
SISKO: I know what the difficulties are. You have your orders.
Dismissed. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kira Nerys, personal log, stardate 50416.2. I've
eliminated three of the suspects from Odo's list. I'm satisfied that
none of them could've committed the murders. The fourth name is Silaran
Prin, a Cardassian living on a planet near the DMZ.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A converted cargo container on a dusty, windy
world. Kira beams in and starts scanning the place. A Cardassian comes
up behind her. She fires but the beam goes through him and he
disappears. Then someone stuns her. The mystery person puts Kira onto a
recliner chair and holds her there with a force field. She wakes.) <br>
SILARAN: A creature born within the comforting anonymity of darkness,
awakens in the harsh truth of daylight. It squirms in the glare, afraid
of the light that pins it to the chair like a needle through its heart.
Its heart beats faster. <br>
KIRA: Who's there? Silaran, is that you? <br>
SILARAN: Panic starts to creep into its soul. Does it understand? Or is
it so blinded by the light that it can think only of returning to the
velvet cloak of darkness? No matter. Perhaps it is better that it
doesn't realise how close death has come. But make no mistake, there is
no escape. It has reached the end, and soon it will die. <br>
KIRA: What's the matter, Silaran? Are you so afraid of a pregnant woman
in a restraining field you have to hide in the dark? <br>
SILARAN: It bares its tiny fangs, hoping for a chance to strike, to
sink its teeth deep into the flesh of its tormentor. But that chance
will never come. <br>
KIRA: You'd better hope I don't get that chance. <br>
SILARAN: And somewhere beneath the gleam of hatred in those eyes lurks
the certain knowledge of its impending death. And it begins to know
fear. <br>
KIRA: I'm not afraid of you. I'm not some coward who's been sending
anonymous messages and bombs to murder innocent people. <br>
SILARAN: No, Kira! I didn't murder anyone. You did! You killed them
all. <br>
KIRA: There. That wasn't so hard, was it? Now we can talk. <br>
SILARAN: Talk and lies won't help you. You're in the light and the
light reveals the truth. And the light shows me no regret in those
eyes, no compassion. <br>
KIRA: You want me to feel compassion for you? You murdered five people.
What compassion did you show to them? <br>
SILARAN: Unrepentant. How unfortunate. I thought you might have
changed, might have found a path out of the darkness. <br>
KIRA: What am I supposed to be repentant for? What're you talking
about? <br>
SILARAN: That is part of your guilt. You did this to me. <br>
(Finally we see that Silaran is a badly mutilated Cardassian.) <br>
SILARAN: And you don't even know who I am. <br>
KIRA: So you were wounded during an attack I carried out when I was
part of the resistance, and I'm supposed to feel guilty? We were at
war, Silaran. Fifteen million Bajorans died during the occupation and
you want me to feel sorry for you? <br>
SILARAN: No, I wasn't part of your war. I was an innocent. I wasn't
even in the military. You know what I did on Bajor? I was a servant. I
cleaned uniforms for Gul Pirak. <br>
KIRA: Gul Pirak. Commander of the weapons depot at Hathon. <br>
SILARAN: I'm glad that you remember. Now, do you remember what you did?
How you put a plasma charge outside his bedroom window in the middle of
the night? <br>
KIRA: I remember he executed fifteen Bajoran farmers because they
refused to display the Cardassian banner outside their homes. <br>
SILARAN: Trentin Fala showed you how to circumvent the defence system.
Latha Mabrin built the plasma charge. Furel and Lupaza stood guard
outside while you crept up to the house. <br>
KIRA: None of us liked killing. We were fighting for our freedom
against <br>
SILARAN: You vaporised the entire east wing! Twelve Cardassians were
killed, including Gul Pirak's entire family. Twenty three others were
crippled. Don't you feel guilty? Don't you feel ashamed of what you
did? <br>
KIRA: None of you belonged on Bajor. It wasn't your world. For fifty
years you raped our planet and you killed our people. You lived on our
land and you took the food out of our mouths, and I don't care whether
you held a phaser in your hand or ironed shirts for a living. You were
all guilty and you were all legitimate targets! <br>
SILARAN: And that's what makes you a murderer. Indiscriminate killing.
No sense of morality. No thought given to the consequences of your
actions. That's what makes us different. <br>
KIRA: I was a soldier. You're just a bitter old man out for revenge. <br>
SILARAN: I am bringing the guilty to justice. And unlike you, I take
care to protect the innocent. I could have killed every monk in that
cavern or everyone on the runabout, or half the population of Deep
Space Nine, but I didn't. Only the guilty have died. And that is why,
although though your actions have condemned you, the life of your child
will be spared. <br>
KIRA: What does that mean? What does that mean? <br>
SILARAN: The creature's diseased mind cannot understand its plight. Its
imagination is too limited to perceive the truth. It cannot be saved.
But there is still hope for its child. It can be taken from the womb
and raised in the light. <br>
KIRA: Listen to me, Silaran. The child I'm carrying, it isn't Bajoran,
it's human. It has unique medical needs. If you force me to give birth
now you risk <br>
SILARAN: The creature's cries grow louder, but no one can hear them.
All that remains is to bring the child into the light and discard the
diseased carcass of the mother before it can infect it's offspring. <br>
KIRA: You can't bring it into the light! Not yet! Doctor Bashir said if
I don't have
at least three more weeks <br>
SILARAN: It's time. <br>
KIRA: We both agree this baby's an innocent. Don't put him at risk,
please, Silaran. <br>
SILARAN: Don't worry. I promise that I'll take care of the child and
that I'll teach him the difference between darkness and light. <br>
(He lights up a laser scalpel.) <br>
KIRA: Wait. Please, I'm begging you. At least give me a sedative. Show
some compassion. Don't just cut me open. <br>
SILARAN: All right. I'll show more mercy than you have. Take a good
look at my face, Kira. I want it to be the last thing you see. <br>
(He gives her a hypo.) <br>
SILARAN: The creature slept, dreaming its dark dreams and happy to be
out of the light. The innocent life it held would awaken in brilliance,
and never know darkness again. <br>
(He turns off the forcefield and Kira kicks him away. She gets the
phaser and shoot him.) <br>
(Some time later, Sisko, Bashir and Odo beam in.) <br>
ODO: Are you all right? <br>
BASHIR: She's fine. There's a large amount of merfadon in her system. <br>
SISKO: Merfadon? <br>
BASHIR: It's a sedative, but the makara herbs she's been taking have
counteracted the effect. <br>
SISKO: I take it this is our assassin? <br>
ODO: Why did he give you a sedative? <br>
KIRA: He wanted to protect the innocent and separate the darkness from
the light. But he didn't realise the light only shines in the dark and
sometimes innocence is just an excuse for the guilty. Let's go home. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Defiant. <br>
