PALLRA: I didn't kill him, you know. A lot of people believed it was
me. That shape-shifter thought so. But he was wrong. <br>
QUARK: It was a long time ago. <br>
PALLRA: Say what you will about the Cardassians, at least they could
keep the power on. Would you like more ice? <br>
QUARK: I'm fine. <br>
PALLRA: You were always very kind. <br>
QUARK: Was I? <br>
PALLRA: You made life a little easier. <br>
QUARK: I ran a black market for anyone who could pay. Never exactly
thought of myself as kind. <br>
PALLRA: There was always that little extra ginger tea in that package
you gave me, wasn't there? <br>
QUARK: You didn't call me to Bajor to talk about tea. <br>
PALLRA: No. I need a favour. <br>
QUARK: For old times sake? <br>
PALLRA: That's right. <br>
QUARK: I'm still as kind as ever. <br>
PALLRA: I can pay you. <br>
QUARK: I'm listening. <br>
PALLRA: My husband kept a strongbox in our shop on the station, buried
in the wall. I want you to bring it to me. <br>
QUARK: What's in it? <br>
PALLRA: Nothing anyone would value. <br>
QUARK: Anyone but you. <br>
PALLRA: Sentimental reasons. <br>
QUARK: Why not take a sentimental journey back to the station, if it's
your property? <br>
PALLRA: I couldn't stand being back in that shop where my husband was
murdered. <br>
QUARK: Or maybe you'd rather not let Odo see you there. <br>
PALLRA: I'm sure he's forgotten about all that by now. Can you
neutralise the security system? It's behind the panelled wall on the
left as you enter. Four panels in, five up. <br>
QUARK: Four in, five up. <br>
PALLRA: And I can pay you five bars of latinum. <br>
QUARK: Five? <br>
PALLRA: And as always my personal gratitude. <br>
QUARK: A day, maybe two. <br>

the request of Commander Sisko, I will hereafter be recording a daily
log of law enforcement affairs. The reason for this exercise is beyond
my comprehension, except perhaps that humans have a compulsion to keep
records and lists and files. So many, in fact, that they have to invent
new ways to store them microscopically, otherwise their records would
overrun all known civilisation. My own very adequate memory not being
good enough for Starfleet, I am pleased to put my voice to this
official record of this day. Everything's under control. End log.

QUARK: You? We'd be at it all night. <br>

QUARK: Tomorrow morning, I'm changing my entire lock system. Four in,

I burn off the panel. <br>
ROM: The glare could attract attention. I have a better idea. <br>
QUARK: A better idea? <br>
ROM: I took the liberty of bringing along a small vial of magnasite
drops. <br>
QUARK: Magnasite drops? What are magnasite drops? <br>
ROM: A compound that will eat through duranium one on each corner and
the panel will fall off. <br>
QUARK: How do you know that? <br>
ROM: When you were in the Gamma Quadrant overnight we did very good
business. Naturally, I had to keep your profits safe, but you had the
only key to the latinum floor vault. <br>
QUARK: You got into my latinum floor vault with that? <br>
(Fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, clunk) <br>
ROM: I didn't want to tell you because then you'd know I'd burned off
your floor plates, but I replaced them out of my own salary, brother. <br>
QUARK: My floor vault. <br>

ROM: A treasure map, perhaps? (a list in alien writing) What does it
mean, brother? <br>
QUARK: I have no idea. Eight names. All of them Bajoran. I want to get
a picture of this list before I reseal the box. Go, get me an imager.
Go. <br>

killed! <br>

BASHIR: Ten cc's of cortolin. I want an anti-grav lift in here, stat!
Ready the cortical stimulator. What kind of weapon? I am waiting for an
answer! <br>
ODO: Whatever it was had to get by the scanners. My best guess is a
compressed tetryon beam weapon. <br>
BASHIR: Okay, okay, that's consistent with what I'm seeing here. Get
the stimulator over here. <br>
SISKO: Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Thoracic cavity ruptured. Extensive neural trauma. Now. <br>
(Quark jolts) <br>
ODO: Rom says it was a robbery attempt. <br>
SISKO: Was anything taken? <br>
ODO: He says he doesn't know, but he knows. <br>
KIRA: Security's stopping everyone at the airlocks but it took them
five minutes to get in position. The assailant may already be on a

SISKO: Delay all outgoing vessels as long as you can. Advise their
respective security details. <br>
BASHIR: We've got to get him to the surgery. Help me get him up here. <br>

brother dies? <br>
ODO: Do? Oh, you'll have a lot to do once this place is yours. <br>
ROM: But if he dies. Mine? <br>
ODO: Wives serve, brothers inherit. Rule of Acquisition number one
hundred thirty nine, if I'm not mistaken. <br>
ROM: I hadn't thought of that. <br>
ODO: Really? I had. Because it's a solid motive for murder. <br>
ROM: Yes, actually, I have heard of a few untimely deaths that seemed.
Wait a minute, you're not suggesting that I? <br>
ODO: I've had my eye on you for a long time, Rom. You're not as stupid
as you look. <br>

their own flesh and blood for a Cardassian groat. <br>
SISKO: Odo, he's a family friend. His son is very close to my boy. <br>
ODO: Well, you'd better tell his son that Dad's going to the lunar
prison on Meldrar One. Two hundred degrees in the shade. <br>
ROM: I didn't! It's not true! Oh! Irony of ironies. I finally get the
bar and I'm falsely accused of my brother's murder. <br>
SISKO: Rom, as a friend, if you know anything that might be helpful, I
think you should tell us. <br>
ROM: It was a list. The man who shot my brother stole a list. <br>
ODO: What kind of list? <br>
ROM: Of names. Eight Bajoran names. It was in this box we, we found. <br>
ODO: Found? <br>

retrieve it. <br>
ODO: Who? <br>
ROM: He didn't tell me. He never told me anything. I tried so hard to
earn Quark's trust. Now he's dead, and I can never earn his trust. <br>
ODO: Just his share of the profits. <br>
ROM: I swear I don't know who hired him. All I know is that the box had
been hidden years ago. <br>
ODO: How many years ago? <br>
ROM: I'm not sure. When the Cardassians were here. When the ship's
store used to be the chemist shop. <br>
ODO: The chemist shop? <br>

DUKAT: Yes, yes, please come in. I'm Gul Dukat. We've met before. <br>
ODO: Have we? <br>
DUKAT: I wouldn't expect you to remember. I was one of the guests at
the reception at the Bajoran Centre for Science. It must have been two
years ago. <br>
ODO: Ah, yes, when the Cardassian High Command was invited to view me. <br>
DUKAT: You were very amusing that night. <br>
ODO: Was I? <br>
DUKAT: Yes. You did a Cardassian neck trick that brought the house
down. <br>
ODO: The Bajoran scientist who worked with me thought you might find it
entertaining. He made me practice for weeks on the Cardassian neck
trick. <br>
DUKAT: Gul Hadar couldn't stop talking about it. He wanted to send you
out to entertain the troops. I, on the other hand, began to wonder if
you couldn't provide a more valuable service for the Cardassian Empire.
I've stayed informed about you, Odo, ever since you walked out on your
Bajoran keepers. <br>
ODO: I simply felt I could learn more outside a laboratory. <br>
DUKAT: Yes, you've become quite the student of humanoid nature, haven't
you? <br>
ODO: Just what is it you need, Gul Dukat? <br>
DUKAT: Have you ever seen a dead man before? <br>
ODO: Yes. In your mines. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, those are casualties. This is murder. (removes the cloth
from the body) And I've decided you're going to investigate it. <br>
ODO: Me? Why me? I'm no investigator. <br>
DUKAT: Ah, but I suspect you'd make a good one, shape-shifting your way
into places the rest of us can't go. <br>
ODO: I have no intention of being a Cardassian agent. <br>
DUKAT: Not an agent. An investigator. <br>
ODO: There's a difference? <br>
DUKAT: We can't have these Bajorans running around murdering each
other, now can we? I'm talking about order here, justice. <br>
ODO: There's very little justice in the Cardassian occupation of Bajor.
<br>
DUKAT: Don't push me, Odo. My superiors would have me solve this murder
by rounding up ten Bajorans at random and executing them. I'm hoping
you'll give me a better alternative. Now, these Bajorans won't talk to
us but they seem to trust you. I understand you used to sort out petty
disputes concerning food, blankets, everyday sorts of things. They come
to you. <br>
ODO: I suppose I'm considered a neutral observer. <br>
DUKAT: Of course. You're not one of them. And for that you should be
thankful. So, here's one more petty dispute, only this time I'm
bringing it to you. Find the murderer. <br>

know. Why are men like that? <br>

PALLRA: We had two wonderful years together, till she arrived. And now <br>

shed a tear. <br>

the epidermis below the eyes swells noticeably. Your epidermis is
perfectly normal. <br>

murder, I believe? <br>

PALLRA: Good for him. <br>
ODO: Does the name Ches'so mean anything to you? <br>
PALLRA: I don't think so. Who is it? <br>
ODO: Oh, just someone I'd like to talk to. Thank you for seeing me. <br>
PALLRA: If this has anything to do with my husband's murder, I want to
be of help in any way I can. <br>
ODO: Oh, there was one other thing. I understand your power was
recently terminated for lack of payment. <br>
PALLRA: That's right. <br>
ODO: Yet you were able to transfer funds to the power company this
morning. <br>
PALLRA: I don't appreciate your looking into my private affairs. <br>
ODO: Just part of a routine investigation. If you could tell me where
you got the money? <br>
PALLRA: A loan from a friend. <br>
ODO: Of course. And your friend's name? <br>
PALLRA: Odo, this really has nothing to do with your investigation. <br>
ODO: Good. Then you won't mind giving me the name. <br>
PALLRA: I'm sorry. My friend is married. I won't drag him into this.

KIRA: I've got some good news and some bad news. I think I've found our
Ches'so. <br>
ODO: Who is he? <br>
KIRA: A Bajoran mining engineer. He's been very active in charity work
for the war orphans. <br>
ODO: What makes you think he's our man? <br>
KIRA: Some connections from my past suggested he might be. His work
brought him to the station a lot. The bad news is he's dead. Drowned in
a pond on his property last night. <br>
ODO: I'm responsible. <br>
KIRA: How? <br>
ODO: I mentioned the name Ches'so to the Vaatrik woman. If she
recognised it as
Ches'sarro, and thought he might lead us to her. Security to the
Infirmary. <br>
SECURITY [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
ODO: Major, I need some help. Advise the Medical Examiner that I want a
complete autopsy on Ches'sarro, and that his death is to be treated as
a suspected homicide. I'll need the communication records for the
Vaatrik home for the past fifty-two hours and have the Central Bank
keep a supervisor on duty all night. I'll need several bank records as
well. <br>
KIRA: Whose? <br>
ODO: I don't know yet. <br>

ODO: I want round the clock armed security on Quark. No visitors. <br>

QUARK: Are you here to arrest him? <br>

ODO: I don't drink. <br>
QUARK: A soft drink, then. <br>
ODO: I don't drink. <br>
QUARK: I guess that's why we don't see you around here much. <br>
ODO: I'd like to ask you a few questions about the death of the Bajoran
chemist. <br>
QUARK: Wait a minute. You're the shape-shifter. You're the one who's
working for Dukat. <br>
ODO: I'm not working for Dukat. I'm just trying to solve a murder. <br>

I right? <br>

QUARK: That could go over big in this room. <br>
ODO: I'm checking on the alibi of a young Bajoran woman, red hair,
named Kira Nerys. She says she was here last night <br>
QUARK: Yeah, I remember her. She wanted a job. <br>
ODO: How long was she here? <br>
QUARK: Long enough. <br>
ODO: Long enough for what? <br>
QUARK: Oh, you know. <br>
ODO: No, I don't. Why don't you tell me. <br>
QUARK: She was showing me her, er, initiative. <br>
ODO: Is that some sort of sexual reference? <br>
QUARK: These jobs are hard to come by. Her credentials were very
impressive. (Odo grabs his lapels) Hey, listen. Listen here, what's the
problem? <br>
ODO: The problem is you're lying. <br>
QUARK: You've got me all wrong. <br>
ODO: I want the truth otherwise I'll just turn you over to Gul Dukat
and he can get it for me. <br>
QUARK: Okay, fine, I didn't realise we were dealing with a murder here.
She didn't pay me enough for that anyway. <br>
ODO: She paid you for an alibi? I wonder how Gul Dukat will react when
I tell him about that. <br>
QUARK: I'm sure it'll cost me a case of Cardassian ale. <br>
DUKAT: Two cases at the very least. A broken alibi. That sounds like
progress. Is there someone you want me to arrest? <br>
ODO: Not yet. <br>
DUKAT: But soon. I need a name, Odo. <br>
ODO: You'll get your name when I'm certain it's the right name. <br>
DUKAT: Listen to the way he speaks to me, Quark. You're not afraid of
anyone, are you, shape-shifter? Not even me. I was right about you. You
are the man for this job. <br>
QUARK: Listen, I feel you and I, we've gotten off to a bad start here.
Let me make it up to you. You need anything? A little ginger tea? No,
you don't drink. Chocolate? Maybe companionship?

DAX: Is Quark? <br>
ODO: Quark is stable. <br>
SISKO: What's this? <br>
ODO: The list. <br>
DAX: You found it? <br>
ODO: No, I assembled it from the Vaatrik woman's communication records.
She's been talking to each of these people a lot. Odd thing is, she'd
never talked to any of them until two days ago. <br>
SISKO: When the list was stolen. <br>
ODO: Interestingly, every one of them has transferred exactly one
hundred thousand Bajoran litas into her bank accounts within the last
twenty six hours. <br>
SISKO: Blackmail? <br>
ODO: Blackmail. <br>
SISKO: What did they have to hide? <br>
ODO: For one thing, that they'd come out of the occupation with that
kind of money. <br>
DAX: You think they were working with the Cardassians. <br>
ODO: Selling out their own world for a profit. Collaborators. Not even
a Ferengi would do that. It explains a lot of things. <br>
SISKO: Do you have enough to charge her? <br>
ODO: Not yet, but I'd like to bring her in for questioning. With your
permission, I'll
ask the local Bajoran authorities transport her here. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO [OC]: Nobody ever had to teach me the justice
trick. That's something I've always known. A racial memory from my
species, I guess. It's really the only clue I have to what kind of
people they are. Are these kinds of thoughts appropriate for a
Starfleet log? I don't care. There's no room in justice for loyalty or
friendship or love. Justice, as the humans like to say, is blind. I
used to believe that. I'm not sure I can anymore.

me a killer. <br>

ODO: So why don't you start telling the truth? <br>
KIRA: Whose side are you going to be on, Constable? <br>
ODO: I'm not going to play your game. <br>
KIRA: When I tell you the truth, you'll have to choose. <br>
ODO: No. No, that's why I was given this job. That's why all of you
always come to me with problems. I'm the outsider. I'm on no one's
side. All I'm interested in is justice. If you're innocent, you'll go
free. If you're not, I'll turn you over to Cardassian authorities.
That's the only choice here. <br>
KIRA: I didn't kill him. When he was killed, I was on level twenty one.
<br>
ODO: Twenty one? Ore processing? <br>
KIRA: Check the Cardassian security logs. You'll see a breach on twenty
one last night. I'm in the Bajoran underground. I came here to commit
acts of sabotage against the Cardassians. Last night, I succeeded. <br>
ODO: The ore processor was damaged by a sub-nucleonic device at twenty
five hundred hours last night. It'll be out of operation for two weeks.
<br>
KIRA: Give the mine workers a little time off at least. I'll describe
the device I used if you still don't believe me. <br>
ODO: That's why you needed an alibi from Quark. <br>
KIRA: If you tell the Cardassians the truth, none of this will matter.
I'll be executed for the sabotage. Who cares about Bajorans killing
Bajorans when you can hang a rebel. <br>
DUKAT: Is this her? <br>
ODO: I told you when I have the name <br>
DUKAT: Is this her? <br>

DUKAT: If you're lying, shape-shifter. <br>

know I don't lie. I am convinced that she did not kill Vaatrik.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: When did you realise? <br>
ODO: The possibility occurred to me when you got the name Ches'sarro so
quickly. Your friends from the underground must have already suspected
him of being a collaborator. Once I knew the eight names were a list of
collaborators the murder of Vaatrik made sense for the first time. He
must have been a collaborator too. He had the money for ginger tea. He
had the private quarters. I never had a motive for his murder until
now. He kept his wife in relative luxury. She surely wouldn't have
killed him. So who would kill a Cardassian collaborator? Someone in the
Bajoran underground, of course. <br>
KIRA: A colleague of mine was given the job of sabotaging the ore
processor. Vaatrik was my responsibility. <br>
ODO: You were here to execute him. <br>
KIRA: No. I was here to find the list. The names of the Bajorans who
were selling us out. We'd been informed that Vaatrik was their direct
link to Dukat. <br>
ODO: That must have been why Dukat chose me to investigate. He had to
stay as far away from this incident as he could so as not to endanger
his network of Bajoran sympathisers. <br>
KIRA: Obviously, I never found the list. But that's what I was looking
for in his shop when Vaatrik walked in on me. I didn't have a choice. <br>
ODO: I misjudged you, Major. You were a better liar than I gave you
credit for. <br>
KIRA: You were working for the Cardassians. <br>
ODO: I haven't been for more than a year. You've had all that time to
tell me the truth. <br>
KIRA: I tried to tell you the truth a hundred times. What you think of
me matters a lot. I was afraid. <br>
ODO: That might affect our friendship? Maybe it doesn't have to. <br>
KIRA: Will you ever be able to trust me the same way again? </font>
