wormhole every week. <br>
WORF: It must stop. <br>
SISKO: It's going to stop. <br>
O'BRIEN: How do we keep them out? <br>
SISKO: We're going to mine the entrance to the wormhole, prevent the
Dominion from bringing any more reinforcements to Cardassia. <br>
WEYOUN: Either you remove the mines or we will take this station from
you and remove them ourselves. <br>
(DS9 is attacked.) <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf, all weapons fire at will. <br>
DUKAT: I've been waiting for this moment for five years. <br>
NOG: We've lost main power to the shields. <br>
WORF: What are your orders, Captain? <br>
SISKO: We've done all we can here. Notify all remaining Starfleet
personnel. We're evacuating the station. <br>
DAX: I heard you're not coming with us. That you've been assigned to
Martok's ship. <br>
WORF: It might be some time before we see each other again. <br>
DAX: Worf, we might never see each other again. <br>

SISKO: Cadet. <br>
NOG: Long range scanners show no sign of Jem'Hadar ships. Looks like
they've broken off their pursuit. <br>
O'BRIEN: I guess they got tired of looking at our backs. Three months
of bloody slaughter and what have we got to show for it? Not a damn
thing. Engage, retreat, engage, retreat. Just once I would've liked to
have gotten a look at their backs. <br>
SISKO: Chief, that's enough. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sorry, sir. Nothing a little sleep won't cure. <br>
DAX: We could all use some sleep. What has it been, seventy eight
hours? <br>
NOG: Shouldn't we have heard something from the Seventh Fleet by now? <br>
DAX: I wouldn't worry just yet. The Tyra system is far enough away that
it'll be a day or two before we get any message. <br>
NOG: You think they can stop the Dominion? <br>
O'BRIEN: Damn right they can. Somebody has to.

hope, Doctor. I would think that all those lunches we've shared
would've entitled me to preferential treatment. <br>
BASHIR: Look, I have twelve wounded officers and crewmen out there, all
of whom are in a lot worse shape than you, Garak. <br>
GARAK: Well, if you're trying to cheer me up, it's working. I feel
better already. <br>
BASHIR: What happened? <br>
GARAK: I was studying some star charts for Captain Sisko during the
last assault when I had a sudden and rather violent encounter with a
bulkhead. <br>
BASHIR: You'll live. <br>
GARAK: I wish I shared your confidence. I'm sure my head will heal, but
the way this war is going I wouldn't bet on any of us living to a ripe
old age. <br>
BASHIR: I admit the odds are not good, but they could be worse. <br>
GARAK: Let me guess. You've used that genetically enhanced brain of
yours to calculate our chances of survival. <br>
BASHIR: It really wasn't that difficult. I simply started with a
binomial <br>
GARAK: I'm really not interested, Doctor. Ever since it's become public
knowledge that you're genetically engineered, you've used every
opportunity to show off. <br>
BASHIR: I have nothing to hide anymore. I might as well use what I
have. <br>
GARAK: Well, what are our chances? Over fifty percent? <br>
BASHIR: Thirty two point seven. <br>
GARAK: I'm sorry I asked. You're certain about that figure? <br>
BASHIR: Do you want me to take you through the entire set of
calculations? <br>
GARAK: Not really. Genetically engineered, indeed. <br>
BASHIR: Excuse me? <br>
GARAK: Well look at you. You act as if you haven't a care in the world.
It's exactly that kind of smug, superior attitude that makes people
like you so unpopular. <br>
BASHIR: Are you trying to insulting me? <br>
GARAK: A thirty two point seven percent chance of survival. I call that
insulting. <br>
BASHIR: Don't take it so personally, Garak. It's strictly a matter of
mathematics. <br>
GARAK: No, it's strictly a matter of our lives. You're not genetically
engineered. You're a Vulcan. <br>
BASHIR: If I'm a Vulcan, then how do you explain my boyish smile? <br>
GARAK: Not so boyish anymore, Doctor.

sending us next? <br>
SISKO: I don't know. But if I have anything to say about the matter,
we'll be going right back to the front lines. <br>
MARTOK: Well said, Captain. And my ship will be at your side. <br>
DAX: Worf! <br>
(She leaps into his arms for a kiss.) <br>
MARTOK: Tell her. <br>
DAX: Tell me what? <br>
WORF: It can wait. <br>
MARTOK: No, it cannot. Raktajino. It's been weighing heavily on his
mind. <br>
DAX: What is it, Worf? What's wrong? <br>
WORF: It is about our wedding. <br>
DAX: You're getting cold feet? <br>
WORF: You have scheduled the ritual sacrifice of the targ to occur
after the wedding feast has been served. <br>
DAX: We haven't seen each other for five weeks and that's the first
thing you say to me? <br>
WORF: We agreed it would be a traditional ceremony. <br>
DAX: Okay, have it your way. First we'll shed blood and then we'll
feast. <br>
WORF: As it should be. <br>
MARTOK: He has been unable to talk about anything else for days. <br>
DAX: He's such a worrier. <br>
SISKO: Take my advice, old man. A small wedding is the way to go. <br>
DAX: You get married the way you want, and I'll get married the way I
want. I'll see you later, Captain <br>
SISKO: Try not to break any bones. <br>
(Dax and Worf leave.) <br>
MARTOK: Now that that's settled, I'm going to take care of this.
Klingons make great warriors but terrible doctors. <br>
BASHIR: Captain. <br>
MARTOK: Just the man I wanted to see. <br>
BASHIR: We've been ordered to report to Starbase three seven five for
reassignment. <br>
SISKO: Something else, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: I have news of the Seventh Fleet. <br>
SISKO: Go on. <br>
BASHIR: Only fourteen ships made it back to our lines. <br>
MARTOK: Fourteen out of a hundred and twelve. <br>
BASHIR: We can't keep taking these kinds of losses, sir, not if we
expect to win this <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Doctor. That will be all. <br>
BASHIR: I'll take a look at that arm now. <br>

brings reports of new victories. The war continues to go well. The
enemy is retreating on almost all fronts. It's only a matter of time
before the Federation collapses and Earth becomes another conquered

and the Dominion. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEYOUN: My dear Major Kira, you have no idea how it
pleases me to hear you say that. Dukat, the Major has just given me the
most wonderful news. Bajorans are returning to the station. <br>
DUKAT: I'm well aware of it. <br>
WEYOUN: Then I'm sure you share my delight in knowing that life here is
returning to normal. The shops are reopening, the Promenade is abuzz
with activity once again. The Habitat ring echoes with the laughter of
happy children. <br>
DAMAR: I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. <br>
WEYOUN: Are such precautions really necessary? <br>
DUKAT: I've found that one can't be too careful when dealing with the
Bajorans. <br>
KIRA: What's wrong, Dukat? Afraid we'll take the station away from you
again? <br>
DAMAR: You're welcome to try. <br>
WEYOUN: Come now, come now, there's no need for this petty bickering.
We're all friends here. <br>
KIRA: Are we. <br>
WEYOUN: Of course we are. And if you have any suggestions, Major, feel
free to bring them to me at any time. <br>
KIRA: Fine. We'd like the station's Bajoran security force reinstated. <br>
DAMAR: I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. <br>
KIRA: That's right. <br>
DUKAT: The station no longer requires a Bajoran security force. Our
troops can handle any problems that might arise. <br>
KIRA: The Federation and Bajor always shared equal responsibility for
station security. I thought you said that we would have the same
arrangement with the Dominion. After all, we are all friends here,
aren't we? <br>
WEYOUN: Perhaps you should reconsider your decision. <br>
DUKAT: The order stands. You may trust the Bajorans, but I don't. And
until they earn my trust, I prefer to keep them unarmed. And if you
were in my position, Major, you would do exactly the same thing. <br>
WEYOUN: Perhaps it would be best to let the matter rest for a while.
I'm sure in time, We'll be able to resolve all these minor problems to
our mutual satisfaction. <br>
KIRA: I'll remember you said that. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm sure you will. One last thing. Odo. <br>
KIRA: What about him? <br>
WEYOUN: Is he aware that I'm doing everything I can to strengthen the
bond between the Dominion and the Bajoran people? <br>
KIRA: Why don't you ask him yourself? <br>
WEYOUN: No, no, I wouldn't want to bother him. Good day, Major. <br>
(Kira leaves.) <br>
DUKAT: She's a fascinating woman, isn't she? <br>
WEYOUN: I wouldn't know. But I do know we need her as an ally. <br>
DAMAR: The Bajorans will never be our allies. <br>
WEYOUN: Out. Don't look at him. I'm telling you to leave. Now! <br>
(Damar takes his signal from Dukat and leaves.) <br>
DUKAT: I find him useful. <br>
WEYOUN: In the future, it might be prudent for you to include me in all
decisions relating to station policy. Now, what about the wormhole? You
assured me that you would be able to dismantle the minefield within a
month. That was two months ago. <br>
DUKAT: Well, I admit the work is proceeding more slowly than expected,
but as you know, these are not ordinary mines. Every time we deactivate
or destroy one of them, its neighbour replicates a new one. <br>
WEYOUN: We have to take down that minefield and reopen the wormhole. <br>
DUKAT: And we will. But there's no need for panic. We are winning the
war. <br>
WEYOUN: For the moment, yes. But to defeat the Federation, we're going
to need reinforcements and new supplies of ketracel-white. Soon. <br>
DUKAT: Weyoun, I said I will deal with the minefield, and I will.

QUARK: Good evening, gentlemen. Once again I see you're at your usual
table. It's amazing how many of my customers think of Quark's as their
second home. I only wish I had a holo-imager so I could preserve this
warm and wonderful moment of camaraderie. Something you could hang on
the wall of your barracks. (no response) Have you tried the dabo
tables? I'm sure one of my lovely hostesses would be happy to teach you
the game. (zilch) I know. A complimentary hour in one of our
state-of-the-art holosuites? Whatever your desires, I'm sure we can
satisfy them. (a Look) Perhaps another time. Enjoy the evening. <br>
(Moving away) <br>
QUARK: Tough crowd. <br>
KIRA: I'm telling you, Odo, Dukat has only one thing on his mind, and
that's revenge. He can't stand the thought that Bajor defeated
Cardassia. <br>
ODO: You think he wants to reopen the labour camps? <br>
KIRA: Eventually. <br>
ODO: Well then, I suppose we should be grateful that he has Weyoun
looking over his shoulder. <br>
KIRA: Maybe. Weyoun's a hard one to figure out. I don't really trust
him but I trust him more than Dukat. <br>
ODO: Weyoun knows that it's in the Dominion's best interest to honour
its treaty with Bajor. They want to prove to the rest of the Alpha
Quadrant that they're true to their word. <br>
KIRA: Weyoun asked me about you. He seemed very concerned about what
you thought of him. <br>
ODO: I try not to think of him. <br>
KIRA: He'd be hurt to hear you said that. I'll have to mention it to
him. <br>
ODO: I'm glad you can still smile. <br>
KIRA: Only when I'm with you. <br>
ODO: That's kind of you to say. <br>
KIRA: No, it's true. When I talk to you, things don't seem as bad. When
I think of Dukat in the Captain's office, or the fact that the
Federation seems to be losing this war and we're here doing nothing. <br>
ODO: I share your frustration, Major, but right now there's really
nothing we can do but bide our time. It's like Captain Sisko said.
Bajor must be kept out of the fighting. <br>
KIRA: And who am I to argue with the Emissary. <br>
QUARK: (bringing a drink) Thanks for waiting. Things have been a little
busier than expected. This one's on the house. <br>
KIRA: What do you want, Quark? <br>
QUARK: The usual. Peace, love and understanding. Not to mention a
generous profit margin, which I'm happy to say is looking more and more
likely. You know, I never expected to say this, but as occupations go,
this one's not so bad. <br>
KIRA: No, I suppose that's true if all you're worried about is a
monthly balance sheet. <br>
QUARK: I'm not just concerned with profit, Major. Look around. Do you
see any ghetto fences dividing the Promenade? Or exhausted Bajoran
slave labourers sprawled on the ground after a gruelling day in the Ore
Processing Centre? Do you hear the cries of starving children? I don't.
Now don't get me wrong, I miss the Federation too. All I'm saying is,
things could be a lot worse. <br>
ODO: I hate to say this, but he's right. The Dominion seems determined
to prove that it can be a friend to Bajor. <br>
KIRA: If it's such a good friend, why are no Bajoran security officers
on the station?

telling me that space is big, that it's an endless frontier filled with
infinite wonders. <br>

be more than enough room to allow people to leave each other alone. <br>

DAX: Nog. <br>
NOG: Resonance emitters, check. Subspace field grid, check. Signal

O'BRIEN: You think? We've been training on this ship for two weeks now.
<br>
NOG: I would like to put a Jem'Hadar soldier on the Defiant and see how
well he does after two weeks. These controls are very different. They
take time to get used to. <br>
O'BRIEN: We don't have any more time. We're about to take this ship
into enemy territory. We don't want any slipups. <br>
NOG: I don't intend to make any, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good. <br>
NOG: I still don't see why we couldn't install a few chairs on the
bridge. <br>
O'BRIEN: Because this ship wasn't designed for chairs. <br>
NOG: Well, my feet aren't designed to stand for long periods of time.
They get tired. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe we should leave you behind. <br>
NOG: My feet might like that, but I wouldn't. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's not your feet that you need to worry about, it's your
stomach. Have you noticed? There isn't a single food replicator
anywhere on this ship. <br>
NOG: That shouldn't be a problem. Captain Sisko says there'll be plenty
of field rations. <br>
O'BRIEN: Try eating nothing but field rations for three weeks and then
tell me it isn't a problem. <br>
DAX: You want to know what is a problem? No viewscreen. Who builds a
bridge without a window? <br>
BASHIR: The same people who build a ship without an Infirmary. Here's a
list of all the medical supplies I brought on board. They're in my
quarters, for want of a better place. <br>
DAX: Don't worry, we'll try not to have any medical emergencies while
you're sleeping. <br>
BASHIR: I'm so glad that you find the lack of proper medical facilities
amusing. But if trouble breaks out, it's not a viewscreen or a chair or
even a sandwich you'll be wanting. It's a bio-bed with a surgical
tissue regenerator. <br>
DAX: Maybe. But right now I would settle for a viewscreen. <br>
NOG: Or a chair. <br>
O'BRIEN: Or a sandwich. <br>
SISKO: All right, people. Prepare for departure. <br>
DAX: All systems ready, sir. <br>
BASHIR: Garak, come to see us off? <br>
GARAK: Not quite. <br>
SISKO: I invited Mister Garak to join us. Considering we're heading
into Cardassian territory, I thought he might prove useful. <br>
GARAK: Well, it's been known to happen. <br>
O'BRIEN: Pull up a chair. <br>
NOG: We're cleared for departure, sir. <br>
(Sisko puts on the headset with virtual viewscreen eyepiece.) <br>
SISKO: Take us out, old man. <br>
DAX: Aye, Captain. Aft thrusters at one half. <br>
SISKO: Bring us about. <br>
(The ship makes a sudden lurch to the right.) <br>
DAX: Just wanted to make sure everyone was awake. <br>
SISKO: We are now. Just take it nice and easy, all right? <br>
DAX: I can try. <br>
SISKO: Set a course for the Cardassian border, heading zero five four
mark zero nine three. Warp six. <br>
DAX: Yes, sir.

back on it's stand.) <br>
DUKAT: Come in. <br>
KIRA: You wanted to see me? <br>
DUKAT: I always want to see you, Major. And therein lies the problem.
It's been three months since my return to this station and you and I
have barely spent any time with one another. Oh, I know you can point
out the various meetings we've attended together, but they never seem
to offer us the opportunity to venture beyond station business. <br>
KIRA: I don't have time for this. <br>
DUKAT: Major! I haven't dismissed you yet. <br>
KIRA: What do you want from me, Dukat? <br>
DUKAT: Come now, Major. Have the last three months been that bad? <br>
KIRA: Is that what you want? Is that why I'm here? To flatter you? To
tell you know what a good job you've doing and how happy we all are to
have you back? <br>
DUKAT: Sarcasm doesn't become you, Major. It's your directness that
I've always found most appealing. <br>
KIRA: Dukat, I've got better things to do than to stand here and help
you play out one of your little fantasies. <br>
DUKAT: You feel I've betrayed you. <br>
KIRA: Not just me, everyone. Even your own people. <br>
DUKAT: Cardassia was on the edge of an abyss, Major. The war with the
Klingons left us into a third-rate power. My people had lost their way.
I've made them strong again. <br>
KIRA: At what price? You sold Cardassia to the Dominion. <br>
DUKAT: Yes, a high price, to be sure. But look what we're getting in
return. The Alpha Quadrant itself. <br>
KIRA: We'll see about that. <br>
DUKAT: Yes, we will. Oh, I could make things very pleasant for you
here, Kira. <br>
KIRA: You could start by doing something about your breath. <br>
DUKAT: I'm a patient man. I can wait. <br>
KIRA: Wait for what? What do you think is going to happen here, Dukat?
That you're going to wear me down with your charming personality? That
I'm going to be swept off my feet by that insincere smile? Are you
really so deluded that you actually believe that we're going to have
some kind of intimate relationship? <br>
DUKAT: Oh, we already do. Good day, Major. I have work to do. <br>

the side effects of wearing that headset. <br>
SISKO: At least we know one side effect. Headaches. <br>
BASHIR: Well, the headsets were designed to be worn by the Vorta and
the Jem'Hadar, not humans. <br>
GARAK: Captain, may I make a suggestion? <br>
SISKO: Only if you talk softly. <br>
GARAK: We saw Dukat wearing one of these headsets during the attack on
Deep Space Nine. Perhaps Cardassian physiology is more compatible. <br>
SISKO: Are you volunteering? <br>
GARAK: I suppose I am. This ship is equipped with two of them. If I
wore one, then you wouldn't have to. At least, not all the time. <br>
BASHIR: I agree with Garak, Captain. The less you wear it, the better. <br>
(Sisko hands over the second headset.) <br>
SISKO: Garak. <br>
GARAK: It's like having a viewscreen inside your brain. <br>
NOG: Sir, there's a Federation ship off our starboard bow, bearing one
five seven mark zero nine five. It's the USS Centaur. <br>
SISKO: That's Charlie Reynolds' ship. <br>
GARAK: I see it. <br>
(BOOM) <br>
SISKO: Cadet, open a channel to the Centaur. <br>
NOG: I can't. Our comm. system's down. <br>
GARAK: Perhaps we should consider returning fire. <br>
BASHIR: We can't do that. They're Starfleet. <br>

GARAK: Well, you tell them, not us. <br>

O'BRIEN: We better do something. <br>
SISKO: Dax, get us across the border, maximum warp. I hope Charlie
Reynolds knows better than to follow us into Dominion territory. <br>

SISKO: How long before we cross the border? <br>
DAX: We just did. <br>

NOG: The Centaur's still with us. <br>
SISKO: Charlie never did know when to quit. <br>
O'BRIEN: I hope he knows what he's doing. <br>
GARAK: The question is, do we know what we're doing? <br>
DAX: Captain, that last hit damaged one of our guidance thrusters. <br>
SISKO: Drop us out of warp. Come about. Prepare to return fire. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
DAX: The Centaur has followed us out of warp. <br>
(BOOM) <br>
SISKO: Target their weapons array. Avoid their engines. I don't want to
leave Charlie out here stranded on the wrong side of the border. <br>
DAX: We're coming about for another pass. <br>
SISKO: Charlie likes to swing for the fences so stay in tight. Attack
pattern Omega. <br>
DAX: The Centaur is going to warp. It's heading back to Federation
space. <br>
NOG: Yes! <br>
GARAK: Nice work, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: I didn't know I'd scored a direct hit. <br>
DAX: Maybe you didn't. I'm picking up three Jem'Hadar ships headed this
way. <br>
SISKO: He must have seen them. <br>
NOG: They went right by us. <br>
DAX: Without even bothering to say hello. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're too busy chasing the Centaur. <br>
BASHIR: You think Reynolds will outrun them? <br>
SISKO: Charlie's been in tight spots before. He'll make it. <br>

he's already won. I'd love to show him he's wrong. <br>
ODO: For the moment at least, I'm afraid he has won. Look at me. I
don't know why I bother to sit here every day. I don't even have a
security force to patrol the Promenade. <br>
KIRA: Then ask for one. Demand that they reinstate your Bajoran
