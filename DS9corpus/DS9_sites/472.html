Commander's log, stardate 48959.1. It is with mixed emotions that I
record this, my final Commander's log. The last three years have been
the most demanding and rewarding of my career. I can only hope that the
future will hold even greater challenges. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAKE: Dad, there's something I've been wanting to
say to you for a long time. And now that I finally have the chance, I'm
going to make it short and simple. <br>
(Jake puts another pip onto Sisko's collar) <br>
JAKE: Congratulations, Captain Sisko. <br>
KIRA: Now that you have another pip on your collar, does that mean I
can't disagree with you anymore? <br>
SISKO: No. It just means I'm never wrong. <br>
KIRA: We'll see about that. <br>
DAX: Curzon would've been proud of you, but not as proud as I am. <br>
SISKO: That means a lot to me, Dax. <br>
ODO: Though I don't fully understand this humanoid obsession with rank
and title, if anyone deserves to be promoted, it's you. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Constable. <br>
EDDINGTON: Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title,
congratulations, Captain. <br>
O'BRIEN: That goes for me too, Captain. <br>
QUARK: This calls for a toast. <br>
BASHIR: That better not be from a replicator, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Chateau Cleon, twenty three oh three. I already put it on your
account. <br>
JAKE: Can I? <br>
SISKO: I guess a sip wouldn't hurt. Well. <br>
O'BRIEN: Here's to the newest and best captain in Starfleet. And all I
can say is, it's about time. <br>
ALL: Hear, hear. Cheers. <br>
(Sisko takes Jake's champagne glass from him.) <br>
SISKO: That's enough. Thank you for coming, Ambassador. <br>
KRAJENSKY: Those pips look good on you, Captain. Though to be honest,
I'm not really here for the ceremony. <br>
SISKO: I had that feeling. What can I do for you? <br>
KRAJENSKY: Our intelligence reports indicate there's been a coup d'Ã©tat
on the Tzenkethi homeworld. <br>
SISKO: I doubt anyone is going to miss the Autarch. <br>
KRAJENSKY: I know I won't. Unfortunately, it's too early to tell who's
in control, but we don't want to take any chances. We need to remind
the Tzenkethi that the Federation is committed to protecting our
colonies near their border. <br>
SISKO: You want to show the flag. <br>
KRAJENSKY: Exactly. The Defiant will leave in two days on a week-long
patrol. I'll be coming along as an observer. I've heard a lot about the
Defiant. I'm looking forward to seeing her in operation. <br>
SISKO: I don't think you'll be disappointed. She's a fine ship. <br>
KRAJENSKY: With a fine crew. Now what do you say we get back to the
party? <br>
SISKO: Of course. <br>
O'BRIEN et al: For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good
fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny! <br>
O'BRIEN: Hip hip. <br>

trouble, we'll be ready for them. <br>
SISKO: I don't doubt it, Chief. <br>

SISKO: Told who? <br>
DAX: Captain Yates. About your promotion. <br>
SISKO: Yeah. I barely had time to send my father a transmission. In
fact, I don't even know where Kasidy is. <br>
DAX: She's hauling a load of duridium ore to Solais Five. You could
probably contact her on subspace. <br>
SISKO: I'd rather tell her in person. <br>
DAX: When's she due back on the station? <br>
SISKO: About a month. <br>
DAX: A month! </font></p>

relationship. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't call it a relationship, Dax. I've only taken her out
once. Okay, twice. <br>
DAX: I think the exact figure is three times. <br>
SISKO: She's quite an interesting woman. She's very independent, a
little opinionated, but she has a nice sense of humour. <br>
DAX: And? <br>
SISKO: And? What do you want me to tell you, Dax? <br>
DAX: That you miss her. That you can't wait to see her. I don't know.
Anything. Kira, O'Brien, Bashir, they're all dying of curiosity and,
well, I have to tell them something. <br>
SISKO: Fine. You tell them when she gets back, I'm going to taking her
to the holosuite and we're going to watch the seventh game of the
nineteen sixty four World Series. <br>
DAX: You do like her.

behind him then) <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian! <br>
BASHIR: You called me, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Why didn't you answer me? <br>
BASHIR: I had this spanner in my mouth. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you doing here, anyway? <br>
BASHIR: I was connecting my new diagnostic console to the medical bay's
power grid. <br>
O'BRIEN: I could have done that for you. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, just putting my engineering extension courses to work.
Besides, I know you have your hands full. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh. Where are you going now? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDDINGTON: You wanted to see me, sir? <br>
SISKO: Yes, Commander. It's about Ambassador Krajensky. Please. (they
sit) I know Starfleet doesn't intend for this to be a combat mission,
but just in case the Tzenkethi have other ideas, I want to make sure
the Ambassador is kept out of harm's way. <br>
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the
Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. <br>
SISKO: He won't like it. <br>
EDDINGTON: I won't let that bother me. <br>
SISKO: Very good, Commander. That'll be all. <br>
EDDINGTON: Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief
O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate the sentiment, Commander, but it doesn't really
change anything. I have the assignment I want, I have the crew that I
want. The rank doesn't make much difference. <br>
EDDINGTON: You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become
commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that
everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but
you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. <br>
SISKO: You could always transfer from Security to Command. <br>
EDDINGTON: Then who would protect the Ambassador? <br>
SISKO: Dismissed, Mister Eddington. <br>
EDDINGTON: Thank you, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. We've been unable to

contact Starfleet Command. Let them know what happened. <br>
SISKO: Major, what other starships are in this sector? <br>
KIRA: The closest one is the Ulysses. They're studying protoplanetary
masses in the Helaspont Nebula. <br>
SISKO: That puts them twenty hours away at maximum warp. Lieutenant,
transmit a message to Captain Entebe on the Ulysses. Tell her <br>
ODO: Captain. I'm having trouble getting through to Starfleet Command.
There seems to be a power fluctuation in the communications system. <br>
DAX: I can't get a message out either. <br>
O'BRIEN: The console's functioning normally. The problem must be in the
transceiver assembly. <br>
SISKO: I need that system back online, Chief. <br>

like it. <br>

O'BRIEN: It seems to be linked to key points within the transceiver
assembly. We'd better get it out of there. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(And another one does the growing thing.) <br>
SISKO: You say these things are all over the ship? <br>
O'BRIEN: They've attached themselves to the command and communication
relays, the internal sensors, the transporter, the deflector shield
grid, almost every critical system. <br>
SISKO: Is there any way to get past the forcefields? <br>
O'BRIEN: None that we've found yet. We're still working on it. <br>
SISKO: Well I guess the question is, how did they get aboard? Or should
I say, who placed them here? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know who did it, but I know it definitely happened
after we left the station. I ran a systems check before our departure.
They weren't there then. <br>
SISKO: Which means someone aboard this ship is a saboteur. <br>
DAX: We've got forty seven people on board. Theoretically, anyone of
them could've planted those devices. <br>
SISKO: Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's nothing, sir. It's not even worth mentioning. <br>
SISKO: It doesn't sound like you're too sure about that. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I did see someone crawling about in one of the Jefferies
Tubes the other day. <br>
SISKO: Who? <br>
O'BRIEN: It was Julian. He was connecting a medical console to the
power grid. <br>
SISKO: Which is right next to the communications relay. <br>
DAX: Are you accusing Julian of sabotage? <br>
SISKO: No one's accusing anyone of anything. But I want to talk to
Julian. <br>
DAX: Wait. I think I have a better idea.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: This crew has been through a lot together.
In fact I would trust any one of you with my life. But after looking at
the evidence, there's only one conclusion I can draw. Someone on this
ship is guilty of sabotage. <br>
EDDINGTON: With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin
questioning the crew immediately. <br>
SISKO: That won't be necessary. Lieutenant. <br>
DAX: We found one of the devices planted in the warp plasma conduit.
Which means whoever put it there would've been exposed to trace amounts
of tetryon particles. <br>
KRAJENSKY: And those particles would still be detectable on the
saboteur? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, but not for much longer. They dissipate quickly. <br>
ODO: So you're going to scan all the members of the crew for tetryon
particles? <br>
SISKO: Starting with the senior staff. <br>
DAX: O'Brien and I already scanned positive, since we opened up the
warp core controls during our investigation. <br>
EDDINGTON: You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll be the prime suspects. Yes, we know that. <br>
SISKO: We might as well get started. <br>
(Dax scans Sisko.) <br>
DAX: You're clean. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad to hear it. <br>
KIRA: Might as well do me next. <br>
DAX: You're okay, too. Julian. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, of course. <br>
(Eddington puts his hand on his phaser, just in case.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Nothing. <br>
BASHIR: You sound relieved. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well I am. After all, you were in that conduit the other day. <br>
BASHIR: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
DAX: Ambassador, if you please. <br>
KRAJENSKY: Certainly. <br>
BASHIR: I was never in any conduit. <br>
O'BRIEN: Of course you were. I saw you. <br>
(Beep! And the Admiral morphs into a whirl of goo, and escapes through
the ceiling.) <br>
KIRA: It's a changeling. <br>
SISKO: We've cloaked. Lieutenant, bring us out of warp. Full stop. Now.
Constable, Commander, deploy security teams immediately. I want that
changeling found before he can do any more damage. <br>
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir. <br>
(Odo and Eddington leave) <br>
DAX: Captain. The helm isn't responding. We're still at warp. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't deactivate the cloaking device. <br>
KIRA: The weapons array has activated. The phaser banks are charging
and we've got photon torpedoes online and ready to launch. <br>
DAX: The ship's no longer under our control.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mess hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDDINGTON: Our security teams have gone over every
centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every
crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. <br>
SISKO: Is there any way he could've been transported off the ship? <br>
EDDINGTON: At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I
suppose it's possible. <br>
ODO: He's still here. He won't leave until he's completed his mission. <br>
BASHIR: Which is? <br>
SISKO: It looks like the Dominion is hoping to start a war between the
Federation and the Tzenkethi. <br>
KIRA: If you ask me, the Tzenkethi are doing a pretty good job of that
all by themselves. <br>
SISKO: Not necessarily. The transmission we received from Barisa Prime
could've been faked using that device we found implanted in the
communications relay. In fact, our entire mission could have been
engineered by the Dominion. Think about it. We've been all over this
ship, and we have not seen a trace of the real Ambassador Krajensky nor
his remains. <br>
EDDINGTON: Which means he was probably replaced before we left the
station. <br>
ODO: Maybe the real Ambassador never came to Deep Space Nine at all. <br>
BASHIR: So anything Ambassador Krajensky told us could have been a lie.
The Tzenkethi coup
d'Ã©tat, increased tension along the border, the threat of an attack. <br>
SISKO: And now here we are, cloaked, armed for battle, and headed into
Tzenkethi space. If we can't stop this ship before we cross the border,
we may wind up causing a war rather of preventing one. <br>
ODO: Which is no doubt what my people are hoping for. A war between the
Tzenkethi and the Federation would destabilise the Alpha Quadrant,
making it that much easier for the Dominion to move in. <br>
EDDINGTON: I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot
easier to track down the changeling. <br>
ODO: I'm not sure the sensors would help. If you scan me when I'm a
rock, you'd detect a rock. I may not be able to duplicate a humanoid
perfectly, but I'm guessing he can. <br>
BASHIR: We scanned Ambassador Krajensky for tetryon particles. He
registered as human. <br>
KIRA: Well then right now the changeling could be anything or anyone on
this ship. <br>
SISKO: Then we have to narrow his options. Confine all nonessential
personnel to their quarters and seal them in with forcefields. Doctor,
I want you to review those tricorder readings. See if you can find
anything that will help us find the changeling. And take some security
with you. From here on, no one is to be left alone. <br>
(Bashir and Odo leave.) <br>
SISKO: We have seven hours before we enter Tzenkethi space. I want that
changeling found before then. <br>
EDDINGTON: That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many
precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know
it until it's too late.

BASHIR: I could use a neural stimulator but that might cause
irreversible brain damage. I don't recommend it. <br>

ship without her. <br>
BASHIR: I'm afraid so. I should get back to my patient. <br>

KIRA: The changeling's very clever. Taking out Dax makes O'Brien's job
a lot harder. <br>

Tzenkethi. If O'Brien can't regain control before we cross the border
I'll have no choice but to destroy the Defiant. <br>
(Later, the crew are assembled, including a Bolian.) <br>
SISKO: Our objective is simple. Find the changeling and stop him before
he can do any more damage. We'll break into two-person teams. Each team
will be armed with phaser rifles. <br>
EDDINGTON: We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy
pulse. <br>
ODO: Phasers have been set low enough to avoid damaging equipment, but
high enough to affect the changeling. <br>
SISKO: The changeling could be hiding anywhere. He could look like
anything. So we're going to have to systematically sweep the ship with
phaser fire. Every conduit, every corridor. If he's out there, we'll
find him. Any questions? <br>

BOLIAN: After you. <br>
KIRA: Don't you trust me? <br>
BOLIAN: No, I don't. <br>
KIRA: I know exactly how you feel. Follow me.

EDDINGTON: Don't you ever sweat? <br>
ODO: No, I don't. It's the modified phaser beam. It's heating up the
air. <br>
EDDINGTON: You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was
hiding. Where would you be if you were him? <br>
ODO: I wouldn't know. I'm not him. <br>
EDDINGTON: He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his
position, try to anticipate his next move? <br>
ODO: I've thought about it, but the truth is I don't understand my
people all that well. <br>
EDDINGTON: That's too bad. <br>
ODO: Yes, it is. <br>
EDDINGTON: For all of us.

(They climb down to a junction.) <br>
SISKO: Over there. On three. One, two <br>

escapes.) <br>
SISKO: This is Sisko. The changeling is in Jefferies tube seven A
heading to the lower deck. I'm in pursuit.

tube and a phaser shot just misses his shoulder.) <br>
BOLIAN: The changeling. He's right over there. <br>
(Kira walks round the corner.) <br>
KIRA: Put your phaser down. It's me, Kira. We were on our way to meet
you and we got separated for a second. The next thing I know, he opens
fire. <br>
BOLIAN: You can't fool me. You're the changeling. I saw you come out of
that hatch and go around the corner. <br>
KIRA: I didn't see anyone. Maybe he morphed into the ventilation
system. Or maybe he didn't. For all we know, you may be the changeling.
<br>
BOLIAN: Keep back! <br>
SISKO: Both of you put your weapons down now. <br>
BOLIAN: I can't do that, Captain. <br>
KIRA: You heard him. <br>
(Odo disarms the Bolian and hits him.) <br>
EDDINGTON: (comes in behind Kira) What happened? <br>
SISKO: How long have the two of you been apart? <br>
ODO: At least a minute. <br>
SISKO: Then we've got a problem. Any of us could be the changeling.
You, Kira, Eddington, even me. <br>
ODO: Not you. <br>
SISKO: What do you mean? <br>
ODO: You're bleeding. <br>
SISKO: I cut my hand when the changeling attacked me. <br>
EDDINGTON: What are you getting at? <br>
ODO: When blood leaves a humanoid body it's still blood. But when any
part of me separates from my body <br>
KIRA: It reverts back to a gelatinous state. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Bashir. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: This is Bashir. <br>
SISKO: Doctor, meet us in the mess hall immediately.

(Bashir takes a blood sample from the Bolian.) <br>
BOLIAN: Satisfied? <br>
SISKO: So far. <br>
BASHIR: Who's next? <br>
KIRA: I'll go. <br>
BASHIR: I'd say the Major is exactly who she appears to be. <br>
KIRA: Try not to look so surprised. <br>
BASHIR: There doesn't seem to be any point obtaining a sample from the
Constable. I guess that leaves the three of us. <br>
EDDINGTON: Let's get this over with. <br>
(Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he
had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDDINGTON: This is ridiculous. I'm not the
changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a
fight? <br>
ODO: Inside. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're making a mistake. <br>
KIRA: Do as he says. <br>
(Bang! The door opposite opens and the occupant shouts through the
forcefield.) <br>
BASHIR: Would someone please get me out of here? <br>
(Fake Bashir morphs away into the ceiling. Sisko fires then gives the
nod and Odo follows his countryman.) <br>

KIRA: We've altered course. Our new heading is zero one five mark four
seven. We're headed directly for the Tzenkethi settlement on M'kemas
Three. <br>
SISKO: How long before we're in weapons range of the settlement? <br>

EDDINGTON: Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? <br>
BASHIR: Still unconscious. The changeling gave her enough sedative to
keep her under for days. I've managed to filter most of it out of her
system, but she'll be out for another few hours. I wish I could do
more. <br>
SISKO: You've done all you can, Doctor. Now it's up to Chief O'Brien.

COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in six minutes. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, we're almost there. Look, when we set off this
device there's a possibility we may lose the protective field around
the warp core. If that happens, this room is going to heat up real fast
so give the warp core a wide berth or you'll get a dose of radiation
poisoning even Bashir can't cure. <br>
(Odo morphs in from a grating.) <br>
ODO: Where's the changeling? I lost him in the conduits. <br>
O'BRIEN: We haven't seen him. <br>

ODO 2: Wait. It's me, Odo. <br>
O'BRIEN: You don't say. <br>
ODO 2: Chief, remember the last time we went kayaking in the
holosuites. You had lamb stew for lunch. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's right. <br>
ODO: But you forgot to bring a fork. Anyone could have gotten that
information. <br>
