<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The scene is 'unreal' with slanted camera angle
and slightly out of focus. It is Red alert and Worf is running with his
bat'leth. A badly injured crewman reaches out for help. The bridge crew
are dead. A group of Klingons are celebrating their victory. Worf
enters the bridge to see dead Klingon children at the stations instead
of Federation personnel.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Worf wakes from his nightmare.) <br>
ODO: Are you all right? <br>
WORF: What time is it? <br>
ODO: Oh four hundred. Your hearing starts in four hours. I suggest
trying to get some sleep. You've got a big day ahead of you.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Admiral T'Lara (a Vulcan female) strikes the
ship's bell six times.) <br>
T'LARA: This hearing will come to order. We are here to consider the
request of the Klingon Empire that Lieutenant Commander Worf be
extradited for trial on charges of murder. Advocate Ch'Pok, you may
present your charges. <br>
CH'POK: The Klingon Empire makes the following allegations against
Lieutenant Commander Worf. That on Stardate 49648, while commanding the
Starship Defiant, he knowingly fired upon and destroyed a Klingon
civilian transport ship near the Pentath system. That as a result of
that action, four hundred forty one Klingon civilians were killed. It
is my intention to prove that Mister Worf was grossly negligent in his
command of the Defiant. That his lust for combat overrode his good
judgement. I ask only that he be returned to us to face the judgment of
his own people. Thank you. <br>
SISKO: The Advocate neglected to mention in his opening statement that
at the time in question, the Defiant was under attack by two Klingon
warships. This was a combat situation with hundreds of lives at stake.
It was at that moment, when suddenly the transport ship decloaked in
front of the Defiant. Worf gave the order to fire, not because he was
reckless or negligent, but because he believed he was firing on a
warship. We intend to show that the destruction of the transport was a
tragic, but unavoidable, accident. <br>
T'LARA: I will hear formal evidence beginning tomorrow afternoon at
fifteen hundred hours. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Promenade]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I want to know everything there is to know
about the Klingon who was commanding that transport ship. <br>
ODO: You suspect that he wasn't just on an innocent passenger run. <br>
SISKO: I'm going to argue that he saw the battle and then decided to
join it. That he decloaked in order to attack the Defiant. <br>
ODO: Not the smartest decision he ever made. <br>
SISKO: That's where you come in. Use your contacts in the Empire and
find out something about this captain I can use. Was he reckless, did
he have a reputation for drinking, did he have a death wish? Something.
<br>
ODO: I'll see what I can do. <br>
(Odo gets onto the turbolift.) <br>
CH'POK: Captain. (hands over a PADD) The witnesses I intend to call. <br>
SISKO: Thank you. <br>
CH'POK: A remarkable station, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Thank you. We don't get many Klingon visitors anymore. <br>
CH'POK: After this case is over, you might be seeing a lot more of us. <br>
SISKO: Oh? <br>
CH'POK: When Worf is extradited, the Federation will be forced to admit
that one of its officers committed a massacre. That will put you on the
defensive throughout the quadrant. And while you're busy trying to
repair a badly damaged reputation, we'll find ourselves with certain
opportunities. <br>
SISKO: An opportunity to annex more Cardassian space and set up
additional military bases in this sector? <br>
CH'POK: Possibly. But in any case, Worf is about to present us with
something we never could have won in battle. Sympathy. Any move we make
against you will be seen as a legitimate response to an outrageous
slaughter. <br>
SISKO: You're presuming an awful lot. Worf maintains his innocence. <br>
CH'POK: And you are about to remind me that the burden of proof is
mine. It's an interesting system of justice you have, Captain. It does
have its flaws, however. It emphasises procedure over substance, form
over fact. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry if you feel it puts you at a disadvantage. <br>
CH'POK: On the contrary. I look forward to fighting on your terms. <br>
SISKO: This is not a fight. It's the search for the truth. <br>
CH'POK: The truth must be won. I'll see you on the battlefield.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CH'POK: I have studied Commander Worf's report, the
Defiant's sensor logs, and the reports of the other officers on the
Bridge. And I believe every word of it. It's a point of pride for the
Federation that Starfleet officers never lie or commit fraud, so I will
accept the facts of the case as they have been submitted. <br>
SISKO: Admiral, if there are no facts in dispute, then this hearing
would appear to be at an end. <br>
CH'POK: We Klingons are not concerned with matters of fact and
circumstance. What matters to us is what was in Worf's heart when he
gave the order to fire. Was he just a Starfleet officer doing his duty
or was he a Klingon warrior revelling in the battle? That is why I am
here. Because if he was a Klingon lost in the bloodlust of combat, only
we can judge him, not you. <br>
SISKO: We can't put a man's heart on trial. It's a subjective issue
that cannot be reasoned in a court of law. I ask that the advocate be
limited to arguing the evidence in this case. <br>
CH'POK: Someone told me this was a search for the truth. Should we not
follow that search wherever it takes us? <br>
T'LARA: The question of Commander Worf's motive is relevant. I will
allow you to explore this issue, but only as far as logic permits. <br>
CH'POK: I bow to your judgement. <br>
T'LARA: You may call your first witness. <br>
(The first witness is Dax.) <br>
CH'POK: You're something of an expert on Klingon society, aren't you,
Commander? <br>
DAX: My previous host, Curzon, would have called himself an expert. I
tend to think of myself as having a passing familiarity with your
culture. <br>
CH'POK: In your opinion, as someone with a passing familiarity with our
culture, wouldn't you say the Klingons are a violent, warrior race? <br>
DAX: Yes, there is that aspect to your people. <br>
CH'POK: Would you agree that one of the things that makes a Klingon
warrior so formidable is his predatory instinct, his bloodlust, if you
will? <br>
DAX: I'd agree with that. <br>
CH'POK: Now, when Worf was on the Defiant, engaged in combat, don't you
think his predatory instinct took over? <br>
DAX: I think that instinct was present, but I've seen Mister Worf
restrain it before. <br>
CH'POK: How do you know so much about how he behaves in battle? <br>
DAX: In the holosuite. We've fought many times. <br>
CH'POK: You mean you practiced with Mister Worf. You played with him. <br>
DAX: Oh, no. When we fight, we fight.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(As she remembers a workout similar to that from
Sons of Mogh) <br>
DAX [OC]: I've made it very clear to Mister Worf that I never want him
to take it easy on me because I'm a woman or a Trill.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CH'POK: Have you ever been injured? <br>
DAX: A few bruises here and there. A broken finger once. Nothing
serious. And I've given him a few lumps of his own.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CH'POK [OC]: So you're not afraid of Mister Worf? <br>
(Worf gets his blade against her neck.) <br>
DAX: I'm no fool. I can see the killer instinct in his eyes, and I know
he could kill me if he wants to. But that look always goes away. He
knows when to stop. Ja'cht.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CH'POK: Admiral, at this time I would like to enter
into evidence files I obtained from the defendant's private database
this morning. <br>
SISKO: Objection. There's been no search order issued for those files.
This is a violation of Mister Worf's privacy. <br>
T'LARA: The captain is correct. Without a properly executed search
order, or the permission of the defendant, any information you have
accessed from his private database may not be admitted into evidence. <br>
CH'POK: Ah. I see. Well, I obviously have no search order, so I'll ask
you, Worf. May I enter this files into evidence? Or do you have
something to hide? <br>
SISKO: Don't play his game. <br>
WORF: I have nothing to hide. Use whatever you wish. <br>
CH'POK: Commander Dax, are you familiar with a holosuite programme
known as The Battle of Tong Vey? <br>
DAX: Yes. It's one of the programmes Mister Worf brought with him from
the Enterprise. <br>
CH'POK: Describe it for us. <br>
DAX: It's an historical re-enactment of one of the epic Klingon
battles. Ten thousand warriors under the command of the Emperor Sompek
conquered the city of Tong Vey after a long siege. <br>
CH'POK: A glorious battle. When Worf recreates it in the holosuite,
what role does he play? <br>
DAX: Sompek. <br>
CH'POK: Of course. The conqueror's role. One of our greatest heroes.
Tell me, Commander, what was the final order Sompek gave to his men
once they had conquered the city of Tong Vey? <br>
(Dax doesn't want to answer.) <br>
CH'POK: Commander? <br>
DAX: He told them to burn the city to the ground and to kill everyone
in it. <br>
CH'POK: Everyone? Not just the soldiers, but the people of the town
too? Civilians? Women? Children? <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
CH'POK: Now, Commander, when Mister Worf runs this programme, does he
give the final order to destroy the city and kill all of the
inhabitants? <br>
DAX: It's not the same thing. It's a simulation. <br>
CH'POK: Answer the question. <br>
DAX: That's the way the programme is supposed to end. You have to give
that command <br>
CH'POK: Admiral, I ask that the witness be instructed to answer the
question yes or no. <br>
T'LARA: Yes or no, Commander? <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
CH'POK: Of course he does. Because he is a Klingon warrior. He doesn't
have the same moral code as a Starfleet officer. He is one of us. A
killer, a predator among sheep. <br>
SISKO: Objection! <br>
T'LARA: Restrain yourself, Advocate. <br>
CH'POK: I only have one more question for this witness, Admiral.
Commander Dax, when was the last time Worf used that programme? <br>
DAX: (reading the diary PADD) The day before he left on the convoy
mission. <br>
CH'POK: The day before. The day before. I have nothing further. <br>
(Sisko's turn to be questioned) <br>
CH'POK: Captain, you ordered Worf to command the Defiant on the mission
in question, did you not? <br>
SISKO: That's right. <br>
CH'POK: How did you describe the mission to Worf?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Captain's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: An outbreak of Rudellian plague has struck
the Cardassian colony on Pentath Three. The Cardassians are preparing
several convoys of medical supplies and relief workers, but the Pentath
system borders Klingon territory and the Cardassians are worried about
raids. <br>
WORF: Well, Pentath is a strategically important system. The Klingons
will try to stop them. <br>
SISKO: Now the problem is the Cardassians don't have enough warships
available to protect the relief convoy. They've asked for Starfleet
protection, and because of the humanitarian nature of the request,
we've agreed. There will be seven convoys headed for Pentath Three in
the next week, each of them protected by a Federation starship. The
Defiant has been assigned to escort convoy six, and I've chosen you to
be in command. <br>
CH'POK [OC]: Why did you select Worf for this mission? <br>
SISKO: (to camera) I felt he was an experienced officer who was ready
to take on greater responsibilities. He had a distinguished record and
obviously understood the Klingons.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CH'POK: Weren't you a little worried, Captain, that
Worf, a famed Klingon Warrior, might jump at the chance for battle and
forget about the plague victims? <br>
SISKO: If I were, I wouldn't have given him the assignment. <br>
CH'POK: And you're sure you made your instructions perfectly clear?
That Commander Worf knew he was on a humanitarian relief mission. That
he was not being sent out to seek combat? <br>
SISKO: Yes. <br>
CH'POK: Thank you, Captain. I have nothing further for you. <br>
T'LARA: Captain, since you are also acting as defence counsel, if you
wish to add anything to the record, you are free to do so. <br>
SISKO: Not at this time, Admiral. <br>
T'LARA: Call your next witness.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK (to camera): It was about seventeen hundred
hours. I was doing some cleanup work. Doctor Bashir was at the bar
talking to Etheria, one of the dabo girls. <br>
BASHIR: Have you ever seen the wormhole open? <br>
QUARK: No, wait. It wasn't Etheria. It was Glidia. <br>
BASHIR: Have you ever seen the wormhole open? <br>
QUARK: Or was it Midia? <br>
CH'POK [OC]: Mister Quark, is this necessary? <br>
QUARK: No, no, no. It was Ralidia and she was with Morn. And he was the

please? <br>

Worf come in.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CH'POK [OC]: Was there anything unusual about that?
<br>
QUARK: No, he comes in here all the time. But he was in a good mood. <br>
CH'POK [OC]: And that's unusual?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Well, he's a Klingon, and you people are
rarely in what I would call good moods. Not that you're anything but a
pleasant, charming race. <br>
CH'POK: Let's get back to Mister Worf. Describe what happened next <br>
QUARK: He came in, he ordered a drink, prune juice, I believe, and we
started to talk. I'd heard about the convoy mission so I asked him
about it and he said he was going to be commanding the Defiant. <br>
CH'POK: What was his attitude? <br>
QUARK: Hard to say. He's a very private man. He doesn't share a lot
with his bartender. <br>
CH'POK: Did he seem afraid of the mission? <br>
QUARK: No. <br>
CH'POK: Did he seem excited by the mission? <br>
QUARK: Not excited, exactly. <br>
CH'POK: Then what, exactly?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quark's]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: I just remember asking him. What happens if
the Klingons go after the convoy? And then he got this funny look on
his face. He put down his prune juice, looked me right in the eyes, and
then he said. <br>
WORF: I hope they do.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: What do you have for me, Constable? <br>
ODO: Background on the Klingon transport captain. He'd never been in
the military and he was known to his family and friends as a quiet,
efficient man who was content in his position. <br>
SISKO: Doesn't sound like a man who'd suddenly decide to take on the
Defiant. <br>
ODO: No. <br>
SISKO: What about this story of theirs that the transport ship just
wandered off course into a combat area? <br>
ODO: I checked the flight plan the captain filed and the projected
course was near the border. It would've taken only a very slight error
in navigation for the ship to stray into the fight. <br>
SISKO: But why did he drop his cloak right in front of the Defiant? <br>
ODO: Ah, that's the question no one seems able to answer. <br>
SISKO: No one seems able, or no one seems willing? <br>
ODO: They're too willing to answer questions. That's the problem. I'm
always suspicious of people who are eager to help a police officer. <br>
SISKO: Start looking into the passengers on that ship. Maybe someone
with a grudge against Worf or the Federation was aboard. Someone who
could have seized control of the ship and taken it into the battle. I'm
reaching, I know. But at the moment it's all we have. <br>
ODO: I'll keep looking.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: (to camera) There were two Klingon ships.
A bird of prey and an old battle cruiser. One would engage us while the
other went after the convoy, then they'd switch, the first ship going
after the Cardassians while the second ship came after us. <br>
(BOOM) <br>
KIRA: We've lost the number three starboard shield. <br>
WORF: Come about. The cruiser is taking us too far away from the
convoy. Try to keep our portside to the Klingons. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. This went on for, I don't know, maybe five minutes.
They'd come at us, try to draw us away from the Cardassians, we'd head
back. Then the bird of prey came toward us off the port bow. <br>
(BOOM) <br>
KIRA: I have phaser lock. <br>
WORF: Fire! <br>
(They hit the ship and it cloaks.) <br>
KIRA: We damaged them, but not much. <br>
O'BRIEN: We'd seen them do this cloak and run manoeuvre a few times,
and Commander Worf thought he saw a pattern. <br>
WORF: We have them now. Come to course one eight five mark two seven
eight. Stand by quantum torpedoes, full spread. <br>
KIRA: Aye, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: I ran a quick sensor sweep and then I reported. I'm picking up

none. <br>

O'BRIEN: I stand by his decision. <br>
SISKO: Is there any question in your mind about his motives? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, sir. I've known Commander Worf for nine years. He's an
honourable man. He would never intentionally fire on an unarmed ship. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Chief. <br>
CH'POK: I'm curious, Chief. You said you stand by Commander Worf's
decision. Do you agree with it? <br>
O'BRIEN: I completely support him. <br>

CH'POK: Chief, how many years have you been in Starfleet? <br>
O'BRIEN: Twenty two. <br>
CH'POK: And how many combat situations have you been in? <br>
O'BRIEN: I couldn't even guess. <br>
CH'POK: Try. <br>
O'BRIEN: A hundred, hundred and fifty? <br>
CH'POK: For the record, Chief O'Brien has been in two hundred and
thirty five separate engagements and Starfleet has decorated him
fifteen times. I would like to have him declared an expert in the area
of starship combat. <br>

CH'POK: As humans would say, that would be icing on the cake. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't try eating that cake just yet, if I were you. But you
have told me one thing I needed to know. You're worried about what Worf
might say on the stand. <br>
CH'POK: I'm not worried, but you should be.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Captain. <br>
(Worf goes into the wardroom.) <br>
SISKO: Good news or bad? <br>
ODO: Bad. I checked the backgrounds of every passenger on that
transport. None had any connection with Worf, or grudge against the
Federation, or any motive for seizing control of the ship and attacking
the Defiant. But I'm still not giving up. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate that. But I get the feeling that at this point the
only one who can help Worf is Worf.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: (to camera) The escort mission had proceeded
smoothly for two days. We detected several subspace distortions which
might have been cloaked ships, but nothing definite. <br>
SISKO [OC]: So what was the first sign of trouble, Mister Worf? <br>
(Boom, Red alert!) <br>
WORF: There was no warning. <br>
KIRA: A bird of prey just decloaked off the port quarter. <br>
WORF: Raise shields, arm phasers. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, another ship's decloaking. It's an older battle
cruiser. She's going after the convoy. <br>
WORF: Bring us about.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: How did you feel when the Klingons attacked?
Were you excited? <br>
WORF: Of course. I am a Klingon. We live for battle. <br>
SISKO: So that's all that mattered to you? The chance to fight? <br>
WORF: No, sir. Whatever my personal feelings may be, I do not allow
them to interfere with my duty or my professional judgement. <br>
SISKO: Chief O'Brien says that he disagrees with your decision to fire.
How do you respond to that? <br>
WORF: I respect the Chief's opinion. He and I have served together for
many years, and I consider him a friend. However, he was not in command
that day. <br>
SISKO: What difference does that make? <br>
WORF: It makes all the difference. He is looking back at a decision,
analysing it weeks later. As the commanding officer of the Defiant, it
was my duty to look forward, to anticipate every possible situation. <br>
SISKO: Did you anticipate encountering a civilian ship on this mission?
<br>
WORF: I knew that our convoy would be passing through civilian shipping
lanes, but, in my judgement, the chances of a civilian vessel
decloaking in the middle of a battle were remote. I decided that if I
were engaged in combat I would not hesitate to fire at a decloaking
ship. <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf, I want you to think about the civilians who died on
that transport ship and answer one question. Under the same set of
circumstances, would you do it again? <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. If I had hesitated, I would have been negligent. I
would have been risking my ship, my crew and the entire convoy. <br>
SISKO: Thank you. <br>
CH'POK: Worf, why are you considered an outcast among Klingons? <br>
WORF: I sided with the Federation during the invasion of Cardassia. For
that, Chancellor Gowron stripped me of my name and my family honour. <br>
CH'POK: So, you acted out of conscience and you were punished for it.
How do you feel about that? Angry? Bitter? <br>
WORF: I am angry about the treatment I have received. I felt it was
unjust. <br>
CH'POK: Of course you are. Who wouldn't be? What happened affected your
entire family. The House of Mogh was brought down. Your brother was
ejected from the High Council in disgrace, your lands seized, and now
your son Alexander has to bear the stigma of being the son of a
traitor. Did I miss anything? <br>
WORF: No. <br>
CH'POK: In your opinion, what do they think of you in the Empire, Worf?
<br>
WORF: I am hated. <br>
CH'POK: Why? Because of what you did? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
CH'POK: Are you sure it's not something more basic? <br>
WORF: What is that supposed to mean? <br>
CH'POK: Isn't it obvious? You were raised by humans, on Earth. And now
you wear their uniform. Haven't you really always been a traitor in
your heart? <br>
WORF: No. <br>
CH'POK: Are you telling us that you live with humans but your heart is
Klingon? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
CH'POK: But if your heart is Klingon, how could you fire upon your own
people? <br>
WORF: They fired the first shot. And when that happened, they became my
enemies. <br>
CH'POK: Then why aren't you glad you destroyed that transport? It was
filled with your enemies and their children. <br>
WORF: There is nothing honourable about killing those who cannot defend
themselves. <br>
CH'POK: Are you telling me that you would never attack a defenceless
opponent? <br>
WORF: No, I would not. <br>
CH'POK: Maybe I've been wrong about you. Maybe you aren't really
Klingon in your heart. A true Klingon rejoices at the death of his
enemies. Old, young, armed, unarmed. All that matters is the victory.
Tell me, Worf, did you weep for those children? <br>
WORF: I grieve for them. <br>
CH'POK: Grieve for them? A Klingon doesn't grieve. They died in a
glorious battle! They are with the honoured dead in Sto-Vo-Kor! They do
not want your grief. You dishonour their memories! <br>
SISKO: Objection! <br>
T'LARA: Advocate. <br>
WORF: You will say anything. You have no honour! <br>
CH'POK: I say this. You live with humans because you're afraid to live
with Klingons. <br>
WORF: I fear nothing. And if you would like to pick up a bat'leth and
face me with weapons instead of words, I will prove it to you. <br>
CH'POK: You'd like that, wouldn't you, Worf? You'd love to prove that
you are as strong and courageous as any Klingon warrior. <br>
WORF: I am a Klingon warrior. <br>
T'LARA: Advocate, you are stepping well beyond the bounds of protocol. <br>
CH'POK: And that is why you told the Ferengi you hoped the Klingons do
come for you. You wanted to prove yourself in the eyes of the only
people that matter to you. Other Klingons. <br>
T'LARA: This will stop or I will hold both of you in contempt. <br>
CH'POK: I apologise, Worf. Actually, I pity you. But the person I pity
most is Alexander. Because one day he will come to you and ask, Father
who am I? And you will have to tell him that he is the son of a small,
frightened man who destroyed a ship full of children just to prove his
own courage. <br>
(Worf hits Ch'Pok several times, knocking him down.) <br>
SISKO: Worf, no! <br>
CH'POK: I thought you said you'd never attack an unarmed man. Perhaps
you should have said, not unless I get angry, not unless I have
something to prove. I rest my case.

(T'Lara enters.) <br>
T'LARA: Captain Sisko? <br>
SISKO: Admiral, I apologise for interrupting your deliberations, but I
have some new evidence I'd like to present. <br>
T'LARA: Very well. <br>
SISKO: I'd like Advocate Ch'Pok to evaluate the evidence as an expert
witness on the Klingon Empire. <br>
T'LARA: I will not compel you to testify, Advocate. <br>
SISKO: Care to step onto my battlefield? <br>
(Ch'Pok takes the stand.) <br>
SISKO: Advocate, how would you describe the current relationship
between the Federation and the Klingon Empire? <br>
CH'POK: There is no formal relationship between our two governments. <br>
SISKO: What would you call us? Informal friends? Informal enemies? <br>
CH'POK: I would say there is potential for either label, but at the
moment neither is entirely accurate. <br>
SISKO: Hmm. Interesting. Would you agree that at the moment, it is
difficult for us to trust each other? <br>
CH'POK: Difficult, but not impossible. There are things that transcend
our differences. For example, we trust that this case can be decided
fairly. We have faith in Admiral T'Lara's judgement. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad to hear you have such a profound respect for the
Admiral. But would it be fair to say that outside this hearing you do
not entirely trust us? <br>
CH'POK: Well, it is only prudent that we question your motives now that
we are no longer allies. <br>
SISKO: Of course. And it is only prudent of us to question your
motives. After all, aren't there times when you feel it's in your best
interest to deceive us? <br>
CH'POK: I object to the question. It is vague and hypothetical. <br>
SISKO: Well, can you imagine any circumstance in which the Empire would
deceive the Federation? <br>
CH'POK: I have a poor imagination. <br>
SISKO: Let's see what we can do to spark it. <br>
(Sisko gives Ch'Pok a PADD) <br>
SISKO: Do you recognise these names? <br>
CH'POK: These are the people who were killed on board the transport. <br>
SISKO: You're positive? There are four hundred and forty one of them. <br>
CH'POK: The names and faces of these people are seared into my heart.
This is a list of heroes who died at the hands of a coward. It is a
list I can never forget. <br>
SISKO: They are an interesting group of people aren't they? From every
walk of life. Merchants, soldiers, artists, shopkeepers. <br>
CH'POK: Children. <br>
SISKO: Children. We've done some checking in their backgrounds, and in
our opinion they all appear to be a random group of people who shared
only one thing in common. They travelled on the same ship. Is that your
conclusion as well? <br>
CH'POK: Yes. <br>
SISKO: And it was just fate that led these particular people to board a
doomed ship? <br>
CH'POK: Fate is a human concept. They simply boarded the wrong ship at
the wrong time. <br>
SISKO: And then they did it again. <br>
CH'POK: I don't think I understand your line of <br>
SISKO: Three months ago a Klingon transport ship crashed in the
mountains of Galorda Prime. Of course, everyone assumed the worst, that
the passengers and crew had all been killed. But then, miraculously,
everyone survived. Do you know anyone who was on that ship? <br>
CH'POK: No. <br>
SISKO: Are you sure? You have the names of the survivors right there. I
can understand your confusion. The names in front of you are identical
to the names on this list. The people who were killed in the Defiant
incident. So, what does this mean? Four hundred and forty one people
somehow survived a crash on Galorda Prime and then a few weeks later
they all decide to take another trip, on the same day, on the same
transport ship, under the same captain and crew, and then that ship is
destroyed, too. This is a very unlucky group of people, wouldn't you
say? <br>
CH'POK: I am not an expert on luck. <br>
SISKO: No. You are an expert on the Klingon Empire. So, tell me,
Advocate. Isn't it possible that there were no civilians on the
transport Worf destroyed? Isn't it possible that the ship he saw was
sending out false sensor images and that this whole affair was staged
so that the only Klingon officer in Starfleet would be accused of a
massacre and the Federation would be forced to stop escorting the
convoys? Tell me, Advocate, isn't it possible? <br>
CH'POK: Yes.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Captain. <br>
SISKO: I thought you should know O'Brien and Bashir are throwing a
party for you at Quark's. It looks like quite a bash. <br>
WORF: I am aware of it, but I have much on my mind. Ch'Pok was right. I
did have something to prove when I took command of the convoy and I did
not realise it until I stood there looking down at him, blood trickling
from his mouth. In that moment I remember thinking finally he had given
me what I really wanted. A reason to attack him. And I had that same
feeling when the Klingon ships first attacked. Finally, a chance for
vengeance. I should not have accepted the mission. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad you realise that. That was your first mistake. What was
your second? <br>
WORF: When the ship decloaked, I should have checked the target before
I fired. <br>
SISKO: You're damned right you should've checked. You fired at
something you hadn't identified. You made a military decision to
protect your ship and crew, but you're a Starfleet officer, Worf. We
don't put civilians at risk or even potentially at risk to save
ourselves. Sometimes that means we lose the battle and sometimes our
lives. But if you can't make that choice, then you can't wear that
uniform. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: At ease, Commander. Now, all that being true, the reality is no
harm has been done. There are no dead children on your conscience. You
got lucky. <br>
WORF: I do not feel lucky. <br>
SISKO: And that's why despite everything that's happened you're going
to make a hell of a captain some day. Now, let's go. They'll all be
waiting. Look, this party isn't for you as much as it is for them.
Things got a little tense there for a while. They need a release, a
chance to celebrate. <br>
WORF: But I do not feel like celebrating. <br>
SISKO: Part of being a captain is knowing when to smile, make the
troops happy even when it's the last thing in the world you want to do.
Because they're your troops and you have to take care of them. <br>
WORF: Life is a great deal more complicated in this red uniform. <br>
SISKO: Wait till you get four pips on that collar. You'll wish you had
gone into botany. </font> </p>
