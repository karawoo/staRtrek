Captain's log, stardate 49263.5. At the request of the Karemma Commerce
Ministry, we've brought the Defiant to a remote system in the Gamma
Quadrant to discuss problems that have surfaced regarding our recent
trade agreement.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HANOK: When we first agreed to use the Ferengi as
intermediaries, we did it because we knew the Dominion would never
tolerate direct trade between us and the Federation. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000342/" target="_blank"> James Cromwell</a> under the latex
again.) <br>
QUARK: And we're glad to be of service. I'm happy to say that not a
single Ferengi vessel has been stopped by the Jem'Hadar. <br>
HANOK: Unfortunately, we have found there is little profit in doing
business with the Federation. In order to comply with your all commerce
laws, we have had to pay a series of taxes and fees that have made the
costs too high. <br>
SISKO: What sort of taxes and fees are you referring to? <br>
HANOK: For example, on a recent shipment of Karemman Fleece, a four
percent surcharge was added to inspect the cargo for changeling
infiltrators. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
QUARK: You never know where they might be hiding. <br>
HANOK: And a six percent tariff was imposed to help offset the lost
income of Tarkalian sheep herders. <br>
QUARK: Hardworking people. You have to feel for them. <br>
HANOK: Need I go on, Captain? <br>
SISKO: No. I think you've made your point. <br>
(And Quark gets a very stern Look.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CARSON: (a crewwoman) These are the results of the
last weapons drill, sir. <br>
WORF: These response times are unacceptable, Ensign. <br>
CARSON: They are a little high, sir, but not if you take into account
that <br>
WORF: I want these response times reduced by fifteen percent. Schedule
another drill. <br>
CARSON: Yes, sir. <br>
(Dax sips a drink and proffers a plate of bon-bons.) <br>
DAX: Want one? <br>
KIRA: I'm fasting. Today is Ha'mara. <br>
DAX: Ha'mara? <br>
KIRA: It's the anniversary of the Emissary's arrival. We fast to show
our gratitude to the Prophets for sending him to us. Last night, there
was a Festival of Lights in the Capital. <br>
DAX: Sounds beautiful. Sorry we missed it. <br>
KIRA: Something tells me the Captain scheduled these negotiations so he
wouldn't have to attend. <br>
DAX: Benjamin's never been one for ceremonies, especially where he's
the centre of attention. <br>
KIRA: Oh, I understand how the Captain feels. Still, it would have
meant a lot if the Emissary had been there. <br>
DAX: After being stuck in the mess hall all morning with Quark and
Hanok, I bet he wishes he had gone. <br>
CARSON: Two ships have just entered sensor range. They're Jem'Hadar
warships. <br>
WORF: Red alert. Captain Sisko to the Bridge. All hands battle
stations. <br>
(Sisko and Hanok enter after the opening titles) <br>
WORF: The Jem'Hadar are powering their weapons systems. They are
targeting the Karemma ship. <br>
HANOK: They're here to punish us for meeting with you. If I give myself
up and assume full responsibility, they may spare my ship. <br>
SISKO: I'm not about to turn you over to them. Open a channel. This is
Captain Benjamin Sisko of the USS Defiant. Stand down or we'll be
forced to <br>
(Bang!) <br>
SISKO: Return fire. <br>
DAX: The Karemma ship is coming about. They're moving away, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Tell your people to hold position. We can't protect them if they
run. <br>
KIRA: The Karemma aren't responding to our hails. <br>
WORF: The Jem'Hadar are changing course. They're going after the
Karemma ship. <br>
SISKO: Move to intercept. <br>
(The Karemma ship dives for the planet) <br>
DAX: What are they doing? <br>
HANOK: They're hoping that the Jem'Hadar won't follow them into the
atmosphere. <br>
KIRA: They'd be smart not to. That's a class J gas giant. I'm reading
wind speeds of over ten thousand kilometres per hour. <br>
HANOK: Twenty three of my people are on that ship and they're going to
die because I was foolish enough to defy the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: They're not going to die, Minister. Not if I can help it. Sisko
to O'Brien.

KIRA: There's so much interference our imaging systems are practically
useless. <br>
DAX: We've hit a cross-current. <br>
SISKO: Head into it. <br>
KIRA: We've slipped between two thermal layers. Wind velocities are a
little more manageable here. <br>
SISKO: Hold this altitude. Any sign of the Karemma or the Jem'Hadar? <br>
WORF: No, but sensor range is less than two kilometres. <br>
DAX: There might be a way we can increase it. <br>
SISKO: Let's do it. Mister Hanok, I think it'd be best if you returned
to the mess hall. <br>
HANOK: As you wish, Captain. <br>
(Hanok is escorted off) <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Sir. <br>
SISKO: What's the status of our weapons systems? <br>
WORF: The cloak is not effective in this atmosphere, and the
interference will jam our torpedo guidance systems. <br>
SISKO: What about phasers? <br>
WORF: We'll have to target them manually. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, we have an idea. <br>
KIRA: It's a little trick I learned during the occupation. Sometimes
we'd evade the Cardassian ships by hiding in the Badlands. Sensor range
was limited, so we learned to use an old active-scan system to
navigate. <br>
DAX: It works by echo-location. We send out a modulated tetryon pulse,
and if it reflects off the hull of a ship we can approximate its
location. <br>
SISKO: But won't these pulses give away our position as well? <br>
KIRA: We'd have to alter course and speed after every one. <br>

QUARK: I think I've found the problem. I made the mistake of letting my
brother Rom execute these contracts. <br>
HANOK: Your brother? <br>
QUARK: Yes. I'm ashamed to say it, but he's an idiot. You see, the
Federation and the Karemma have very different laws governing commerce,
and I think poor Rom must've gotten confused by all the legalisms. Now,
I will be more than willing to make up any losses you might have
encountered. In fact, I will pay them back with interest. <br>
HANOK: You cheated me, Quark, and you haven't even have the courage to
admit it. If we survive this, I'll see that you never work in the Gamma
Quadrant again, </font></p>

creating it. Factor in transportation costs and a reasonable profit
margin, and you arrive at a fair price. <br>
QUARK: You make it sound so antiseptic. Where's the bargaining, where's
the scheming, where's the greed? <br>
HANOK: Greed leads to misjudgment, and that can result in a loss of
profits. <br>
QUARK: If there's no risk, there's no thrill. Your way is just barter.
If you want to win big, you've got to be willing to play the odds. It's
like gambling. <br>
HANOK: Gambling is the last recourse of the desperate. Only a fool
would risk losing what he has to chance.

rotation, because that would give people a little more flexibility with
their time. There is a downside because that would mean that every
shift would have to. What am I doing? I'm supposed to keep you awake,
not bore you to tears. I'm sorry. I don't know why this is so hard for
me. All I have to do is talk to you. I mean, what do we usually talk
about? <br>
SISKO: (painful whisper) We talk about work. <br>
KIRA: You're right. That is what we usually talk about. Even when we're
not working. I get the feeling it's not that way between you and Dax,
or you and Chief O'Brien. But then, you're not a revered figure in
their religions. I know you don't like it when I talk about you as the
Emissary, but that's how I think of you. And maybe that's why sometimes
it's hard for me to relax around you. <br>
SISKO: Nerys? <br>
KIRA: Yes, sir? <br>
SISKO: Tell me a story. <br>
KIRA: All right. All right. Do you know the one about the three
brothers who go to Jo'kala? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
KIRA: They were kava farmers, and one day they go into their field and
they see the biggest kava root they'd ever seen. It's as big as a
house. That's going to make us rich, said the oldest. So they decided
to sell it in the city.

O'BRIEN: With all due respect, I think you're riding the men a bit
hard. You have to understand, they're out of their element. They're not
bridge officers, they haven't been to Starfleet Academy. They're
engineers. They're used to being given a problem to solve, then going
out and figuring out how to do it. <br>
WORF: What are you suggesting? <br>

QUARK: We'd better do something about this torpedo of yours. <br>
HANOK: We have to remove the firing diode only I don't know which one
