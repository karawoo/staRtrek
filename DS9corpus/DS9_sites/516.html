<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An after hours tongo game.) <br>
DAX: I risk eight strips, with a purchase at six and a sale of ten. <br>
(Quark is not paying attention.) <br>
DAX: Quark, it's your move. <br>
QUARK: Just a moment. (checking a PADD) I can't believe it. <br>
DAX: You beg me to play tongo with you, and then you don't pay
attention to the game. <br>
QUARK: I'll be right there. <br>
DAX: Let me put it another way. If you don't finish this hand, I'm
going to call it a night. <br>
QUARK: Okay, okay! Who'd have dreamed they'd strike feldomite on
Parsion Three? The Sepian Commodities Exchange is in chaos. Everybody's
selling, prices falling. Evade. <br>
DAX: Are you sure? <br>
QUARK: You heard me, evade! <br>
DAX: Okay. Confront. You owe me fifteen strips of latinum. <br>
QUARK: Take it. That's all I've got left. My antimonium options, my
quadrotriticale futures, my powdered newt supplements all wiped out.
That's it, I'm finished. <br>
DAX: It can't be as bad as all that. <br>
QUARK: It can and it is. I'm up to my lobes in debt. I put the bar up
as collateral to three different brokers. The loans are due in a week.
If I don't come up with the latinum there'll be nothing left of me but
a greasy spot on the Promenade. <br>
(The Bolian barman whispers in his ear.) <br>
QUARK: Here? Now? Tell him I'm gone. <br>
GAILA: If that's the best lie you can come up with, no wonder you're
broke. <br>
QUARK: Gaila! What a pleasant surprise. <br>
GAILA: I doubt it. A clothed female. How titillating. <br>
DAX: Isn't this the cousin that tried to kill you? <br>
GAILA: I see you've heard of me. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to
talk to my dear cousin. Alone. <br>
(Dax leaves.) <br>
QUARK: If you've come for your latinum you've come a long way for
nothing, because that's all I can give you. Nothing. <br>
GAILA: Spare me the sad story. I'm well aware of your financial
situation and I'm here to help. <br>
QUARK: What are you going to do, loan me some exploding latinum? <br>
GAILA: I can understand your scepticism, but I know a way that can help
the both of us. I'm offering you a job. <br>
QUARK: You'd defy the FCA ban on doing business with me? <br>
GAILA: What's family for? Besides, I won't tell if you don't. <br>
QUARK: You want me to sell weapons, don't you? <br>
GAILA: That's what I do. Now I know you've had reservations about
entering this lucrative field. It's dangerous, it's too technical, it's
not a people business. But let me tell you something, cousin. Nothing
could be further from the truth. <br>
QUARK: I've told you before, I can't smuggle weapons through this
station. Odo would be on to me in a second. <br>
GAILA: Who said anything about bringing weapons here? <br>
QUARK: Then what do you need me for? <br>
GAILA: I need you, Quark, to do the things you do best. Public
relations, showing our clients a good time, providing an atmosphere
conducive to closing deals. <br>
QUARK: I can do that. <br>
GAILA: Of course you can. And you'll earn five percent off every sale. <br>
QUARK: Ten. <br>
GAILA: You'll take five. <br>
(Shows him a PADD.) <br>
QUARK: I had no idea. <br>
GAILA: Weapons is a growth industry. In a month, all your debts will be
paid. In six months, the Ferengi Commerce Authority will be begging to
reinstate you. In a year, you'll have your own moon. <br>
QUARK: My own moon. <br>
GAILA: Success or failure? What's it going to be, cousin? <br>
QUARK: What have I got to lose?

the baby.) <br>
O'BRIEN: (sotto) Come in. <br>
JAKE: Morning, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Shh. Quiet. You'll wake him. He only dropped off about an hour
ago. <br>
JAKE: You look terrible. <br>
O'BRIEN: I didn't get much sleep. He woke up every hour or two. Every
time I tried to put him back in his crib he started crying again. He
misses his mother. <br>
JAKE: When is Professor O'Brien due back from Bajor? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know. A week, maybe two. However long it takes to get
that blight under control. <br>
JAKE: That long? <br>
O'BRIEN: On top of that, Annel had some kind of family emergency, so
I'm stuck without a babysitter. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry about it, Chief. Everything's going to be fine. I'll
take care of Yoshi. <br>
O'BRIEN: Huh? <br>
JAKE: Absolutely. <br>
O'BRIEN: You sure you're up to it? <br>
JAKE: Absolutely. I've babysat Ensign Pran's hatchlings a couple of
times, made sure their little wings didn't get tangled. <br>
O'BRIEN: Kirayoshi doesn't have wings. <br>
JAKE: Even better. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think he's worn himself out. He should sleep now. If he
wakes up, give him one of his bottles. There's diapers in the bag over
there. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry, Chief, I know the drill. Now go to work. You need
the rest. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll be fine. I went through the same thing with Molly. It's
just a phase. He'll grow out of it sooner or later. Gently now. <br>
(O'Brien passes baby over. Yoshi gurgles.) <br>
JAKE: You see, no problem. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll check in with you at lunch. If you need me, I'm just a
comm-line away. <br>
(Yoshi starts crying.) <br>
JAKE: He, he <br>
O'BRIEN: Give him to me. Shh. There, there, there. Shh, shh, shh.<br>
(Yoshi goes quiet.) <br>
JAKE: You're good. <br>
O'BRIEN: He feels safe with me. Give me the bag. I'm taking him with
me. <br>
JAKE: To work? <br>
O'BRIEN: What choice do I have? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Quark is rattling the chairs.) <br>
GAILA: Would you stop doing that! <br>
QUARK: Shh. Just being careful. Odo could be anywhere or anything. <br>
GAILA: Quark, we saw him walk down the Promenade five minutes ago. <br>
QUARK: He's very tricky. <br>
GAILA: There he is. <br>
QUARK: Where? <br>
GAILA: How good to see you again. <br>
HAGATH: The pleasure's all mine. <br>
(Yes, that is the wonderful Steven Berkoff.) <br>
GAILA: Quark, this is my associate, Hagath. <br>
HAGATH: Quark. And my companion, Talura. Your cousin speaks very highly
of you. <br>
QUARK: I've always said my cousin is an excellent judge of character. <br>
HAGATH: I admire confidence in a man. In fact, I demand it of my
salesmen. But in business, one must be careful not to grow too
confident. <br>
QUARK: That can be a fatal mistake. <br>
HAGATH: I believe the phrase you used to bring me here was an
opportunity of a lifetime. <br>
GAILA: An accurate description. <br>
HAGATH: Show me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Holosuite]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Various weapons on display stands.) <br>
HAGATH: Very nice. <br>
(He hefts a rifle.) <br>
HAGATH: Its weight and balance appears just right. <br>
QUARK: We have a wide range of targets for you to choose from. <br>
HAGATH: That won't be necessary. <br>
(He fires at Quark. No damage done.) <br>
HAGATH: A perfect replica. It even pulls a little to the right, just
like the real ones. <br>
QUARK: These are the finest holosuites in the sector. <br>
HAGATH: I believe it. Remember we sold a hundred and fifty thousand of
these to the Manchovites. <br>
GAILA: And we sold another hundred thousand to the other side. Now
there was a beautiful little war. <br>
HAGATH: Too bad about the armistice. <br>
GAILA: Well, all good things must come to an end. <br>
QUARK: You sell weapons to opposing sides? <br>
HAGATH: On occasion. It's very dangerous. If either side realises what
you're doing, it could be most unpleasant. <br>
GAILA: But as they say, the riskier the road, the greater the profit. <br>
HAGATH: True. Well, I'm glad I came. This solves many of our problems. <br>
GAILA: It certainly does. No actual weapons coming in or out, so we
don't break any local laws. All shipping happens outside Federation
space, so Starfleet can't touch us. And since all we're demonstrating
are holograms, we can even show off the specialty items. <br>
HAGATH: Gaila, well done. <br>
GAILA: It was all Quark's idea. <br>
HAGATH: Quark. You really are a find. I'm sure we're going to
accomplish great things together. <br>
QUARK: I can't wait. <br>
HAGATH: Just one thing. Don't cross me, Quark. Don't ever cross me.
Understood? <br>
QUARK: Completely. <br>
HAGATH: Right. Now, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like to see my
quarters. <br>
(Hagath leaves.) <br>
GAILA: If he were a bit shorter and his teeth were a little sharper,
he'd make a perfect Ferengi. <br>
QUARK: Why'd you tell him this was my idea? <br>
GAILA: I want him to like you.

QUARK: The Breen CRM one-fourteen works equally well against moving
vessels or surface emplacements. It's guaranteed to cut through
reactive armour in the six to fifteen centimetre range, and shields to
four point six gigajoules. <br>
CUSTOMER: It's light. <br>
(He blows up a Dopterian interceptor) <br>
CUSTOMER: Nice. <br>
(He disintegrates a big robot.) <br>
QUARK: The quick recharge is one of its most popular features. <br>

QUARK: It's a pleasure doing business with someone who appreciates a
fine weapon. <br>

HAGATH: You're a natural salesman. <br>
QUARK: I am, aren't I? It's no different than selling sandwiches. <br>

QUARK: You wanted to see me? <br>
HAGATH: Just a moment. Who would have thought that so much money can be
made from Andarian glass beads. How did things go with the Proxcinians?
<br>
QUARK: He purchased seven thousand tritanium plated assault skimmers. <br>
HAGATH: Good. And he'll be back for more. The Proxcinian war is just
heating up. <br>
QUARK: Lucky us. <br>
HAGATH: I suppose you're wondering when you'll start seeing your share
of the profits. <br>
QUARK: It had crossed my mind. <br>
HAGATH: I'm afraid it won't be soon. <br>
QUARK: I don't understand. <br>
HAGATH: I took the liberty of transferring your earnings directly to
your creditors. You'll be happy to know they were most appreciative. <br>
QUARK: I would have paid them their money. <br>
HAGATH: I don't doubt your intentions, but money does strange things to
people and I can't afford to have an associate distracted with
financial difficulties. So, until your debt is paid, you won't be
seeing any profit. <br>
QUARK: And once my debts are paid? <br>
HAGATH: Your earnings will be yours to do with as you will, as long as
you remain solvent. Quark, do forgive me. You see, my associates are
like family to me and I feel it's my duty to keep them from getting
into trouble, and to shower them with affection. (gives him a box) Go
on, open it. <br>

to throw from farther away, but he is genetically engineered. <br>
BASHIR: Chief, don't you think you should put the baby down? <br>
O'BRIEN: I haven't put Yoshi down for a week. If I can carry him at
work, I can carry him here. <br>
BASHIR: There must be some babysitter on the station that can pacify
him. <br>
O'BRIEN: You want to bet? <br>

KIRA: The Bajoran government insists that Deep Space Nine not interfere
with the lawful transactions of Hagath or his associates. Hagath
supplied arms to the Resistance. Without him, or people like him, we'd
all be dead. The Cardassians would still be in power. We owe him. <br>
ODO: Captain! <br>
SISKO: I don't like it any more than you do. <br>

SISKO: You better hope there isn't a next time, mister. I have cut you
a lot of slack in the past. I even looked away once or twice when I
could have come down hard on you. But those days are over. Now, we may
not be able to get you for selling weapons but you so much as litter on
the Promenade and I will nail you to the wall. <br>

were making a mistake. Sell weapons to the Bajorans? <br>

Cardassians. <br>
QUARK: But why did you sell weapons to the Bajorans? They couldn't have
had much money. <br>
HAGATH: My dear Quark, not every deal is about making money. Sometimes,
you have to look at the big picture, and at times gaining a friend is
more important than making profit. <br>
GAILA: I admit it's not the Ferengi way, but it's good business
nonetheless. <br>
HAGATH: I knew the Cardassians would eventually lose, and you know why?
<br>
QUARK: Because they were overly confident. <br>
HAGATH: Exactly. They underestimated the Bajoran thirst for freedom. I

about to close that deal with the Verillians. <br>
HAGATH: Oh really? I heard they had no longer any need of our services.
<br>
FARRAKK: Since when? <br>
HAGATH: Since they signed an agreement with Metron Consortium. I also
heard that you hadn't even opened negotiations with the Verillians. <br>
FARRAKK: That's a lie. <br>
HAGATH: And that instead of doing your job, you were off enjoying
yourself on Risa. <br>
FARRAKK: I can explain. <br>

GAILA: Quark, as long as we keep the holosuite busy, you've got nothing

GAILA: He's very, very wealthy. <br>

come at a better time for both of us. <br>
QUARK: Why's that? <br>
GAILA: I'm thinking about stepping back, taking it easy for a change.
You could take my place, run things with Hagath. You'd be earning a
bigger share of the profit. <br>
QUARK: Have you spoken to Hagath about that? <br>
GAILA: He likes you, Quark. <br>
QUARK: And I like him. I'd also like a bigger share of the profits. <br>
GAILA: Then everyone's happy. Except for Farrakk. <br>
QUARK: What about Farrakk? <br>

entire empire. And how did she pay me back? By declaring independence
for her homeworld. <br>
HAGATH: Betrayal. It's the one unforgivable sin. Especially when it's
committed by someone you trusted implicitly. <br>
REGENT: Most arms dealers wouldn't understand such considerations. They
have no ideals, no passions except for lining their own pockets. I
always felt you were a man of honour. You're all men of honour. <br>
GAILA: How very perceptive of you, Regent. <br>
QUARK: Now, how can we help you? <br>
REGENT: I want to make an example of Nassuc and her followers. I intend
to eradicate her entire city. <br>
GAILA: What kind of casualties are you looking for? <br>
REGENT: Seven or eight million. <br>
HAGATH: We can help you there. <br>
REGENT: But that's just the beginning. Over the next couple of months,
I would like the death toll to rise slowly but steadily. <br>
GAILA: Can you give us a figure? <br>
REGENT: About twenty million. <br>
(Quark is shocked at this idea.) <br>
HAGATH: Now, what would be most effective? Prions? <br>
GAILA: Either that or a mutagenic retrovirus. What do you think, Quark?
<br>
QUARK: Twenty eight million dead? Can't we just wound some of them? <br>
REGENT: I am here to buy weapons. Are you here to sell them? <br>
HAGATH: Absolutely. Quark was just trying to make a little joke, but
unfortunately Ferengi humour doesn't translate too well. So let's forgo
any further attempts at jocularity, shall we? And get down to the
business!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GAILA: Quark, maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I've been in the weapons business forty years. I want to retire. <br>
QUARK: I don't blame you. <br>
GAILA: But I'm not going to be able to retire if my hand-picked
successor can't control his conscience. <br>
QUARK: The Regent is insane. <br>
GAILA: Stop being so judgmental. It's his bank account, not his mental
health you should be concerned with. <br>
QUARK: But twenty eight million people. That just seems wrong. <br>
GAILA: If Hagath heard you talk that way he would toss you out the
nearest airlock. Look out there. Millions and millions of stars,
millions upon millions of worlds. And right now, half of them are
fanatically dedicated to destroying the other half. Now, do you think
if one of those twinkling little lights suddenly went out, anybody
would notice? Suppose I offered you ten million bars of gold pressed
latinum to help turn out one of those lights, would you really tell me
to keep my money?

JAKE: Way to go, Quark. I had my whole life ahead of me. <br>

O'BRIEN: It's kind of hard to explain, sir. <br>
SISKO: Try. <br>
O'BRIEN: As soon as I took him down there with me, he fell asleep.
Could be the pattern of the lights, the hum of the optronic emitters,
the vibrations of the ODN relays, I'm not sure. But the point is, he's
not crying. <br>
SISKO: Yes. Chief, why don't you take off for a few days off until
Keiko gets back? I think we can manage without you for that long. <br>
O'BRIEN: That won't be necessary, sir. I have the situation well in
hand. <br>
SISKO: What I'm trying say is that keeping Kirayoshi in the pit is not
an acceptable solution. Find another one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. Sir? <br>
SISKO: Yes, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Could we wait till he wakes up before we move him? He only
just dropped off. <br>

Goodbye, Dax. <br>

DAX: Not really. <br>

(Dax goes into the bedroom and closes the door.) <br>
QUARK: Figures. Doesn't matter. Where I'm going you can't follow. What
I have to do, I have to do alone. One man who's had enough, who's going
to stand up and say <br>

QUARK: Our supplier sold all he had to the Minnobia for their war
against the Vek. <br>
HAGATH: This isn't good. I've just been telling the Regent that his
shipment will be delivered within a week. He's leaving right now. He is
not going to be happy, Quark. <br>
QUARK: I know. He'll be stuck with twenty eight million people and no
way to kill them. <br>
HAGATH: I'm glad you're amused, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Lucky for us, I can get hold of some Varaxian LM Seven. <br>
HAGATH: Never heard of it. <br>
QUARK: It's a new biogenic weapon, still in the experimental stage. <br>
HAGATH: Is it effective? <br>
QUARK: They'll be dropping like flies. Only trouble is, I don't know
how much of it I can get. You think the Regent would be satisfied with
only seventeen million people killed? <br>
HAGATH: Well, seventeen million, it's better than nothing. <br>
QUARK: Then what you have to do is tell him there's been a change of
plans. Tell him we have something new to show him. It might take a
little longer to get the results he wants, but we'll give him a twenty
percent discount. In the meantime, I'll have a sample of Varaxian LM
Seven sent here and we'll arrange for a small demonstration. We'll find
a planet with some low-level lifeforms on it nobody will miss. <br>
HAGATH: I'll speak to the Regent, try to keep him from leaving. You
make sure you get this sample here as soon as possible. Don't fail me,
Quark. <br>

I'm finally out of debt. These are the first profits I get to keep. <br>

GAILA: You are scaring me, cousin. <br>
QUARK: Relax. I know selling weapons to opposing sides is dangerous,
but as you said yourself, The riskier the road. <br>
GAILA: Don't quote The Rules of Acquisition to me. If Hagath finds out
we're doing this behind his back, we'll wind up as dead as Farrakk. <br>
QUARK: Only if we fail, and we're not going to fail. we're going to
sell Varaxian LM Seven to both the Regent and the General. <br>
GAILA: Is she interested? <br>
QUARK: Oh, she jumped at the chance. She's as crazy as the Regent. Both
sides will poison each other, we'll double our profits, and Hagath will
be very happy. <br>
GAILA: But what if they see one another, realise what we're doing? <br>
QUARK: It's a busy station. We'll keep them far apart. Just think of
