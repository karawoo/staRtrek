time on Deep Space Nine. </i> <br><br>SISKO: This is the emblem of the Alliance for Global Unity. They call
themselves the Circle. <br>
O'BRIEN: What gives them the right to mess up our station? <br>
ODO: They're an extremist faction who believe in Bajor for the
Bajorans. <br>
SISKO: I can't loan you a Starfleet runabout without knowing where you
plan on taking it. <br>
KIRA: To Cardassia Four to rescue a Bajoran prisoner of war. <br>
(The prisoners are rescued.) <br>
KIRA: Come on. We have a ship waiting. <br>
JARO: What you did today, Major, was declare war on Cardassia.
Thankfully, they declined the invitation. <br>
SISKO: (to Dax) What if I told you that I knew someone who could bring
stability to Bajor. Someone who could unite the factions and give us a
chance to do our job. <br>
SISKO: But Bajor doesn't need a man. It needs a symbol, and that's what
you are. <br>
JARO: The Navarch needed to return here to assume his new post. He's
been made the Bajoran liaison officer to Deep Space Nine. <br>
SISKO: I already have a liaison officer. <br>
JARO: Not anymore you don't. Major Kira is no longer assigned to this
post. She's been recalled to Bajor. <br><i><br>And now, the continuation.</i>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JARO: Frankly, Commander, I'm surprised at your
reaction. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I don't think much surprises you, Minister. <br>
JARO: But I expected you to be celebrating. I was under the impression
that Major Kira has been nothing but trouble to you since <br>
SISKO: Who gave you that impression? <br>
JARO: Common knowledge. <br>
SISKO: Major Kira has my complete respect. She's been invaluable in
establishing this command post. And now she's been dismissed without
anyone consulting me and I don't appreciate it. <br>
JARO: Commander, Starfleet doesn't consult us when they wish to promote
one of their officers. <br>
SISKO: Are you suggesting that this is a promotion for Kira? <br>
JARO: Certainly it is. We must find the proper spot for her. After all,
she's the one who brought Li Nalas back to us. <br>
SISKO: Well then, that's a different matter. <br>
JARO: I'm glad you see it. <br>
SISKO: Yes, of course I do. For a minute I was thinking to myself,
there's a warm wind blowing in from Minicoy. <br>
JARO: I'm sorry? <br>
SISKO: Just an old saying where I come from. It all started with a
famous Ambassador from Minicoy who used to bluster, exaggerate, and
dissemble to get what he wanted. Not at all like you or me. He was a
bag of hot air and everyone recognised him for what he was. <br>
JARO: May I assume you are satisfied with the assignment of Li to fill
your vacant post? <br>
SISKO: I thought you'd want Li to stay in the capital to strengthen the
provisional government. <br>
JARO: Frankly, I'm not sure it's safe in the capital with what's going
on these days. <br>
SISKO: The Circle? <br>
JARO: The fires and graffiti were a nuisance, but two days ago, one of
my fellow ministers was attacked and beaten. We can't risk the same
thing happening to Li Nalas. Look at it this way, Commander. We're
entrusting you with Bajor's greatest hero. Could you have a better
liaison officer than Li Nalas? I think not. <br>
(Jaro leaves and O'Brien comes to the door) <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, your son's been waiting to speak with you on the
com. <br>
SISKO: Jake? <br>
JAKE [OC]: Dad? I'm outside our quarters. Could you come down for a
minute? <br>
SISKO: Is something wrong? <br>
JAKE [OC]: I really think you ought to come down, Dad. <br>
SISKO: On my way.

ODO: You're not? <br>
KIRA: Leaving? I really don't have much choice, do I <br>
ODO: You're not just leaving, Major. You're surrendering. <br>
KIRA: You break the rules, you pay. <br>
ODO: Wait a minute. I want to be sure I heard that correctly. Because
it doesn't sound like the Kira Nerys who has made a career out of
breaking the rules. <br>
KIRA: Well, I guess I broke one too many. <br>
ODO: Major, you've been breaking one too many for fourteen and a half
years. Cardassian rules, Bajoran rules, Federation rules, they're all
meaningless to you because you have a personal code that's always
mattered more. And I'm sorry to say you're in slim company. <br>
KIRA: I'll miss you too, Odo. <br>
ODO: Have you asked Sisko for help? <br>
KIRA: I'm sure he'll do whatever he thinks is best for the station. <br>
ODO: You haven't even gone to him? <br>
KIRA: Well what do you want me to do, Odo? <br>
ODO: Fight for what you want. It's what you do best. <br>
KIRA: Maybe I just want a vacation. <br>
ODO: Idiotic bureaucracy. Now I suppose they'll expect me to break in a
new man. <br>
KIRA: A great man. Li Nalas can handle the job, believe me. <br>
ODO: You did fairly well at it once I smoothed your rough edges. <br>
KIRA: Ha! <br>
ODO: What's so funny? <br>
KIRA: I thought you did fairly well, once I smoothed your edges. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
KIRA: Yes? <br>
DAX: Am I disturbing anything? <br>
KIRA: Stick around, you can help me cry in my synthale. <br>
DAX: I thought I'd better return this epidellic lotion. <br>
KIRA: No, if you like it <br>
DAX: Oh, it's wonderful. <br>
KIRA: Well then, keep it. <br>
ODO: How can you be chatting about skin lotion at a time like this? <br>
(doorbell) <br>
DAX: Do you have any idea where you'll be stationed? <br>
KIRA: Come in. Not yet. They say that after I've taken some leave time,
I've earned a desk at the foreign affairs building somewhere. Doctor. <br>
DAX: Foreign affairs building? <br>
BASHIR: I came to give you my best. <br>
DAX: Well that's rather dull. <br>
BASHIR: I beg your pardon? <br>
KIRA: Dull is a polite word for it. <br>
ODO: Doctor, if you were Kira, wouldn't you at least be complaining to
Commander Sisko? <br>
BASHIR: Look, I just wanted to wish you good luck. <br>
KIRA: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Complaining about what? <br>
ODO: Never mind, Doctor. If she doesn't care, why should we? <br>
BASHIR: Have they given you any reason yet? <br>
DAX: Did they give you any alternative? <br>
KIRA: I do care. No, they haven't. No, they didn't. I really ought to
finish packing. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
BASHIR: You said she doesn't care. You mean about leaving <br>
KIRA: By all means, come on in. <br>
(O'Brien enters) <br>
ODO: She's done well here. She ought to stay here. And I'd say she
needs a little support from her friends, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Well, yes, certainly, but if her orders <br>
O'BRIEN: Er. <br>
KIRA: Chief. Come in. <br>
O'BRIEN: I didn't mean to intrude. I just <br>
BASHIR: Don't worry, Chief. It's all been said. <br>
ODO: I have a good deal more to say, thank you, Doctor. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, I could come back. <br>
DAX: Odo, leave her alone. This is Kira's decision to make. Unless of
course you want me to talk to Sisko. <br>
KIRA: I knew what I was doing. I knew the risk. <br>
ODO: That's not what she asked. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd just like to say, Major, it's been a pleasure serving with
you. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
KIRA: Come in. <br>
BASHIR: Will somebody please explain this conversation to me? <br>
QUARK: A party! For you, I would've reduced my catering rates. <br>
ODO: It's not a party. <br>
QUARK: Whatever. <br>
ODO: What's that? <br>
KIRA: A bottle of my favorite synthale, I think. That's very
thoughtful, Quark. <br>
ODO: It's also very small. <br>
QUARK: I was anticipating a far smaller gathering. I thought, perhaps,
an intimate farewell drink, a sympathetic smile, a shoulder to cry on. <br>
O'BRIEN: As I was saying, Major <br>
QUARK: You'd be surprised how often that works with women. <br>
KIRA: Is this a joke? Did you plan this? <br>
BASHIR: Nobody could have planned this. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
KIRA: We're open for business. Come on in. Join the crowd. Vedek
Bareil. <br>
BAREIL: I hope I'm not interrupting. <br>
KIRA: No. Please come in. These are my (pause) These are my friends. I
had no idea you were coming to the space station. <br>
BAREIL: Nowadays it's probably wiser not to announce those things. <br>
ODO: How bad is it on Bajor, Vedek? <br>
BAREIL: The violence has seriously escalated. It almost seems there are
more weapons on the streets now than during the occupation. <br>
KIRA: How could that be? Where would they be coming from? <br>
BAREIL: I try to concentrate on more spiritual matters. <br>
KIRA: Yes, of course, I mean, I didn't mean to suggest that you <br>
BAREIL: I understand your duties here are finished. <br>
KIRA: Yes, they are. <br>
BAREIL: Do you have any immediate plans? <br>
KIRA: I haven't really had much chance to give it any thought. <br>
BAREIL: Then perhaps I have the perfect solution. Come and stay at our
monastery for a while. It can help when the spirit gets a little
bruised. <br>

place. But it turned out better than I expected. I'm sure it will for
you as well. <br>
LI: I don't even know what I'm supposed to do here. How does a Navarch
fit into this command structure? <br>
SISKO: As I understand the position, you report directly to the
Prophets. But from time to time, I might ask for your help. <br>
LI: Commander, anything you need from me, I will try my best to do, but
I know that I can never replace Major Kira. <br>
SISKO: No one could. <br>

supplies to support an army. <br>

ago. <br>
KIRA: I've discovered it's like riding a bicycle. It comes back to you
right away. <br>
SISKO: Can I bring you back to reality for a minute? <br>
KIRA: Back to reality, or back to DS Nine? <br>
SISKO: Are you still interested? <br>
KIRA: A lot has happened here. I encountered an orb, Commander. It's
given me a great deal to think about. <br>
SISKO: They do have a way of doing that, don't they? Well, I just came
to let you to know that we haven't given up yet, but for the moment
there seem to be some bigger problems for the leaders down here. <br>
KIRA: I heard the gunfire in the distance. <br>
SISKO: That distance is getting closer. The Circle is for real, Major.
They've been armed for a coup and I'm not at all convinced that the
military's going to back the provisional government. <br>
KIRA: I didn't realise. We've been so isolated. <br>
SISKO: Well, I guess I'd better get back. <br>

JARO: Good afternoon. <br>
KIRA: So, you're involved with the Circle. <br>
JARO: I am the Circle, Major. <br>
KIRA: Now I understand why you wanted to ship Li Nalas off to the
station. <br>
JARO: The last thing I need right now is a great war hero capturing the
devotion of the Bajoran people. <br>
KIRA: How can you betray your own government? <br>
JARO: Major, I don't have to tell you. I've heard your opinion of this
government. Government. They can't even agree it is a government, so
they call it provisional. It's just another word for powerless. I won't
allow the Bajoran people to be powerless any more. We have been
doormats to the Cardassians and now the Federation. Any great power
that happens by. We will not be that again. We are a people who brought
art and architecture to countless planets. We don't deserve to be
victims. <br>
KIRA: If you want to change the government, Minister Jaro, you vote to
change it. You don't sneak up from behind it with a dagger. <br>
JARO: We'll discuss politics another time. I need to know, please, what
the Federation will do once our objective becomes clear. Major, I've
heard you have no love for the Federation. I'm not an unreasonable man.
I'm willing to send you back to the station if that's what you want.
I'll give you that station after we get rid of Starfleet. Now, do you
believe they will continue to support the provisional government? <br>
KIRA: How about our own military? I'd worry about them first if I were
you. <br>
JARO: What will the Federation do, Major? What will Sisko do? You know
him better than any Bajoran. No one despises the Cardassians more than
I, Major, but we did learn a few things from them. Like how to
encourage people to talk. <br>

meaning to bring to your attention, Commander. <br>

labyrinths beneath the Perikian Peninsula. <br>

SISKO: Doctor, Lieutenant, you're with me. Mister O'Brien, you'll be
our pilot. Configure the runabout sensors for a full sweep of the
peninsula. Once we find the base, I'll be depending a great deal on
your famous transporter talents. <br>

SISKO: No, it's too dangerous. <br>

be a Navarch. But I can fight in the trenches and I take orders well.
Besides, I owe her one. <br>

he hates them? <br>
