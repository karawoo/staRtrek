last night bear the Cardassian border. <br>
KIRA: That's three in the last three weeks. <br>
BASHIR: At this rate we're going to run out of ships. <br>
KIRA: Well that's not funny. <br>
BASHIR: It wasn't meant to be. Unless Starfleet Command actually starts
doing something about the Dominion threat, the situation's only going
to get worse. <br>
KIRA: What do you want, Julian, a war? <br>
SISKO: What I want is to talk about something else. Chief, what about
Kirayoshi? Is he walking yet? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, not yet. No. <br>
SISKO: Odo, I understand you're going to Bajor next week. Do you plan
to see Doctor Mora? <br>
ODO: Actually, I've cancelled my trip. There's been a seventy five
percent jump in the theft of medical supplies and food rations on DS
Nine. I haven't seen such an increase since <br>
O'BRIEN: Since? <br>
ODO: Since just before the Cardassians were forced to abandon the
station. <br>
BASHIR: On that note, I think I'll turn in. <br>

lot of fun. <br>

tell he was depressed. <br>
NOG: He's not the only one. Look around. There's something in the air.
People are scared. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, but he's usually the one who tries to lift everyone's

when he needs it? <br>
QUARK: I hope I'll be seeing the two of you tomorrow at twelve hundred
hours. <br>
NOG: Why? <br>
QUARK: Why? Haven't you heard? There's going to be an auction of some
of the galaxy's rarest and most valuable antiquities. Here. Find
something you like and make a bid with all that latinum you've got
stashed under your bed. <br>
NOG: Shh! <br>
QUARK: Oh, Nog. You don't really keep it under your bed? <br>
NOG: No, of course not. <br>
JAKE: Where'd you get all this stuff, Quark? <br>
QUARK: I'm just conducting the auction, for a modest commission. The
items up for sale were all aboard an old derelict freighter that the
Bajorans found adrift about a light year from here. The cargo hold was
crammed with valuable items of every description. Antiques, paintings,
vehicles. <br>
NOG: It's all a bunch of junk. Listen to some of this stuff. A mid
twenty fourth century ceramic Romulan water basin, slightly cracked. A
pair of Tellarite shoes, date unknown. A mid-twentieth century human
baseball card. A Tholian pedestal of <br>
JAKE: A baseball card? A mint condition nineteen fifty one <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mayswi01.shtml" target="_blank"> Willie Mays</a> rookie card! Nog,
this is it! <br>

JAKE: It's perfect. This is how I can cheer up my Dad. You know how
much he loves baseball. He'll go nuts when he sees this. <br>
QUARK: Tell him to be here at twelve hundred hours and he can bid along
with everyone else. <br>
JAKE: No. I'm going to bid on this. He's always doing things for me, I
want to do something for him for a change. And this is it. All I have
to do is get him this card. How hard can that be?

JAKE: I'm human, I don't have any money. <br>
NOG: It's not my fault that your species decided to abandon
currency-based economics in favour of some philosophy of
self-enhancement. <br>
JAKE: Hey, watch it. There's nothing wrong with our philosophy. We work
to better ourselves and the rest of humanity. <br>
NOG: What does that mean exactly? <br>
JAKE: It means. It means we don't need money. <br>

JAKE: How much latinum do you have? How much? <br>
NOG: Five bars. <br>
JAKE: Five bars! <br>
NOG: Look, it's taken me a lifetime to save up that much money, and I'm
not going to just throw it away for some baseball card. <br>
JAKE: Not even for my father, the man who made it possible for you to
enter Starfleet Academy. <br>
NOG: Oh no, that's not fair. <br>
JAKE: The man who believed in you when no one else would. <br>

away in a box under a bed than use it to give him endless moments of
happiness. <br>

WINN: So many people have left Deep Space Nine in the last few months.
I'm sure there are times when you must feel as if you're being

SISKO: To what end? <br>
WINN: I don't know. This meeting is being held at their request. You
disapprove? <br>
SISKO: I'm concerned. The Dominion is notorious for its political
intrigue. <br>
WINN: I have some experience in that area as well. This is a delicate
moment for Bajor. This conflict between the Federation and the Dominion
could escalate into open warfare at any moment. A misstep now could
result in the destruction of our world. <br>

solution? A neodymium power cell? Where are we supposed to get all this
stuff? <br>
GIGER: Surely the station commander's son and a promising young cadet
have access to a wide variety of equipment and supplies that would not
be available to someone like myself. <br>
JAKE: It's a very long list. It'll take some doing. <br>
NOG: Wait a minute. What are you planning to do with these things? <br>
JAKE: Nog? <br>
NOG: Look, we can't start delivering equipment and medical supplies to
you without knowing what you're going to do with them. <br>
GIGER: Very well, young man. Let me ask you both a simple question. Do
you want to die? <br>
NOG: No. <br>
JAKE: Not really. <br>
GIGER: Of course you don't, so why should you? Why should any of us end
up as putrefying corpses in wooden boxes stuck in the ground, or
vaporised into subatomic particles and vented into the cosmos like a
bad case of gas? No reason that I can think of. I have devoted my life
to the study of death, and do you know what I found? Death is nothing
more than the result of cellular boredom. <br>
JAKE: Boredom? <br>
GIGER: Think about it. The cells in your body have been doing the same
job, the same dull monotonous routine, every day since you were
conceived. Metabolise, divide, metabolise, divide. Wouldn't you get
bored? Of course you would. So at some point, the cells just say,
'that's it', and you, the unwary victim of cellular ennui, are quite
literally bored to death. <br>
NOG: I never thought about it that way. <br>
GIGER: Doctor Bathkin of Andros Three was the first to come up with the
answer to solving the puzzle of death. Keep the cells energised. Keep
them in the game by teaching them new mitochondrial tricks.
Unfortunately, before he could finish his work, Doctor Bathkin died in
a shuttle accident. Or so they say. And while the soulless minions of
orthodoxy refuse to follow up on his important research, I could hear
the clarion call of destiny ringing in my ears. And now, after fifteen
years of tireless effort, after being laughed at and hounded out of the
halls of the scientific establishment, after begging and scrounging for
materials across half the galaxy, I have nearly completed work on this.
The Cellular Regeneration and Entertainment Chamber. <br>
JAKE: What does it do? <br>
GIGER: I'm glad you asked. It is specially designed to transmit
biogenic energy on a chromoelectric wavelength and send uplifting and
entertaining messages to the nuclei of every cell in your body. Spend
eight hours a day in this machine and your cells will never get bored.
You will never grow old, and most important, you will never die. That
is the goal of my work, nothing less than immortality itself. <br>
JAKE: Excuse us for a moment. <br>
GIGER: Of course. <br>
JAKE: (sotto) What do you think? <br>
NOG: (sotto) I don't know. I'm no expert in cellular chemistry but his
theory sounds a little odd to me. <br>
JAKE: (sotto) He had me going there for a minute, but a Cellular
Entertainment Machine? <br>

SISKO: They're trying to split Bajor from the Federation. <br>
WINN: Forgive me, Emissary, but you've already done that. It was your
advice six months ago that kept Bajor out of the Federation. How did
you put it? Bajor must stand alone. Well, we are very much alone now. <br>
SISKO: Even though you're not a member of the Federation, Starfleet is
committed to the protection of your world. We're not going to stand
idly by and watch the Dominion conquer Bajor. <br>
WINN: Can you promise me that you will not let one Jem'Hadar soldier
set foot on Bajor? Can you promise me that you will use your entire
fleet to protect our planet, even if it means sacrificing other worlds
like Vulcan or Andor or Berengaria, or perhaps Earth itself? <br>
SISKO: I can't make that kind of promise. <br>
WINN: I wouldn't believe you if you did. So you see my predicament. If
we ally ourselves with the Federation against the Dominion, we risk
becoming the first casualty of the next war. <br>
SISKO: And if you ally yourselves with the Dominion, you risk becoming
the next conquered world. <br>
WINN: A most unhappy choice. I have asked the Prophets to guide me, but
they have not answered my prayers. I even consulted the Orb of Wisdom
before coming here and it has told me nothing. So I come to you,
Emissary. You have heard the voice of the Prophets. You were sent here
to guide us through troubled times. Tell me what to do and I will do
it. How can I save Bajor? <br>
SISKO: You want my advice? Then this is it. Stall. Tell Weyoun you have
to consult with the Council of Ministers, or that you have to meditate
on your response. Anything you want, but you have to stall for time. <br>
WINN: Time for what? <br>
SISKO: I don't know. But I do know the moment of crisis isn't here yet,
and until that moment arrives we have to keep Bajor's options open. I'm
aware that this is difficult for you, given our past, but this time you
have to trust me. <br>
(Winn holds Sisko's left ear.) <br>
WINN: Very well, Emissary. We put ourselves in your hands. May we all
walk with the Prophets.

GIGER: Refreshed, regenerated, mildly entertained. I still get a little
bored after the first five hours. <br>

GIGER: Good. Good. Where's the hydrosaline solution? <br>
JAKE: We should have it soon. Nog just got the bear. Don't ask. <br>

top note goes through his skull.) <br>
JAKE: Nog! Turn that down! Nog! I'm working out here! <br>
NOG: So am I! I have to listen to all of Worf's opera recordings and
filter out the sub-harmonic distortions! <br>
JAKE: Can you turn that down? I'm trying to add a little humour to
Kira's speech to the Agricultural Delegation. <br>
NOG: No! I have to listen at precisely eighty two decibels because
that's the volume Worf listens at! Of course, if I could've simply told
him why I needed two metres of electro-plasma conduit from the Defiant,
he probably would've just given it to me and things would be a lot
quieter around here! <br>
JAKE: We can't tell anybody, Nog! (mutes the sound) Now, listen to this
for a second. (reads) Thank you for that kind introduction, and thank
you for inviting me to address you here today. I've always thought it
odd that the topic of water reclamation was usually treated as such a
dry subject. Is that funny? <br>
NOG: No. <br>

ODO: The who? <br>
JAKE: We don't know who they are, but they were after Doctor Giger's
Cellular Regeneration and Entertainment Chamber. <br>
ODO: His what? <br>
JAKE: It's a device used to keep the cells in your body from getting
bored. You see, he was going to transmit messages to people's cells to
keep them entertained so they wouldn't die off and as a result these
people would live forever.

JAKE: I think he was just trying to scare us. Nog, look. <br>
NOG: It's Kai Winn. <br>
JAKE: Do you see who she's talking to? That's the Vedek who was bidding
against us at the auction. <br>
NOG: Jake, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm sure I'm not
going to like it. <br>
JAKE: Don't you see? The Vedek was bidding on that lot because there
was an old Bajoran mandala in it. He must have been working for the
Kai. When they lost, the Kai must have gotten angry. And we all know
how dangerous she is when she's angry. <br>
NOG: What are you saying? That in order to get the mandala she
kidnapped Giger? <br>

NOG: Jake, I'm really starting to worry about you. <br>

WINN: I'm afraid I cannot reveal my recommendations to the First
Minister. You understand. <br>
WEYOUN: Of course, of course. Forgive me for even asking. It is enough
to know that you and I have found so many common interests. I feel that
we are very much alike. <br>

(Two Jem'Hadar appear, then Weyoun enters. They are on the ship, not
the station.) <br>
WEYOUN: Do you think I'm a fool? Let's start at the beginning. What is
the nature of your relationship with Doctor Elias Giger? <br>
JAKE: We barely know him. He had a baseball card that I wanted to give
to my father to cheer him up. My father's the Station Commander, by the
way. <br>
WEYOUN: I know who your father is. Go on. <br>
JAKE: That's it. We wanted the card, and so we agreed to help him get a
few things for his research. We got all the equipment, but he
disappeared about three hours ago and we haven't seen him since. <br>
(Weyoun looks at a Jem'Hadar, who leaves.) <br>
WEYOUN: Do you really expect me to believe that everything you've been
doing for the last twenty two hours has been perfectly innocent? That
it was merely a coincidence that Doctor Giger has been running
experiments with highly charged polaric particles directly below my
quarters? I suppose there's also an innocent explanation to the secret
meetings you've been having with virtually the entire senior staff of
Deep Space Nine, or that Kai Winn met with you immediately after
leaving me? I suggest that you stop playing games with me and tell me
the truth. Quickly. <br>
JAKE: This is all just a misunderstanding. Nothing's going on, and
we're certainly not involved in some secret plot against <br>

orthodoxy. Well, they won't discover the secret of my work without a <br>

WEYOUN: So, there are secrets after all. There shouldn't be any secrets
between friends, Jake. I do want to be your friend. <br>
(Weyoun opens the chest and takes out the baseball card in it's
holder.) <br>
NOG: Do something. <br>
JAKE: All right. We'll tell you the truth. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm listening. <br>
JAKE: We weren't supposed to divulge this, but since you left us no
choice. We're working for Starfleet Intelligence. <br>
NOG: Oh, no. <br>
JAKE: Forget about it, Nog. We have to tell him. We've been
investigating the man whose picture is in your hand right now. Until
yesterday, that man, one Willie Mays, did not exist in any historical
documents. Then, in the blink of an eye, that card appeared on the
station, and at that same moment a bust of Willie Mays appeared at the
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. There's only one explanation. We
suspect that this man is from the future. <br>
WEYOUN: A time traveller? <br>
JAKE: That's right. And so far that card is the only link we have to
him. We must to find out what he's planning to do in the past, or what
he may have done already. We need that card. The entire future of the
galaxy may depend on us tracking down Willie Mays and stopping him. <br>
WEYOUN: I believe you. <br>
NOG: You do? <br>
WEYOUN: Yes. That is, I believe your first story. That you're two
innocent boys trying to give a gift to Captain Sisko. <br>
JAKE: You are very wise. <br>
WEYOUN: Which still leaves the question of what you were doing beneath
my quarters. <br>
NOG: He's harmless. He's just working on a way to become immortal. <br>
WEYOUN: Really? I have a background in, shall we say, creative
genetics. I'd be most interested in hearing your theories. <br>
GIGER: Well, it may take some time to explain. Let me ask you a simple
question. Do you want to die? <br>
NOG: Excuse me? Can we go? <br>
WEYOUN: Of course. <br>
NOG: Thank you. <br>
WEYOUN: Aren't you forgetting something?

station felt like a tomb. I'd never seen so many of my crew depressed
at the same time. But for some reason, it now seems as though a new
spirit has swept through the station, as if someone had opened a door
and let a gust of fresh air blow through a musty old house. Why this is
happening, frankly, is a mystery to me. After all, nothing has really
changed. The Dominion is still a threat, the Cardassians are still
threatening to take the station, and I can still see the clouds of war
gathering on the horizon. So why do I sense a new-found optimism in the
air? But maybe I'm over-thinking this. Maybe the real explanation is as
simple as something my father taught me a long time ago. Even in the
darkest moments, you can always find something that'll make you smile. <br>
