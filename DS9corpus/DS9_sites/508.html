water feature in a town. We pull back to see our Starfleet people in
the new uniforms as seen the movie 'First Contact'.) <br>
DAX: That's it? <br>
SISKO: That's it. The City of B'hala, painted nearly twenty thousand
years ago. <br>
DAX: Hmm. <br>
KIRA: Jadzia, you're looking at the most important Bajoran icon ever
painted. The only known proof that B'hala actually existed, and all you
have to say is hmm. <br>
DAX: No, it's just that you both gave it such a build up I thought it
would be a lot bigger. <br>
KIRA: We've been trying to force the Cardassian government to return
this to us since the end of the Occupation. It's good to have it back. <br>
DAX: I thought you said it was going to be returned to the State Museum
in Ilvia. <br>
SISKO: It will be. Tomorrow. But I couldn't let it pass without
stealing a look. Sometimes being the Emissary isn't such a bad thing.
You see this? (the obelisk) It's a Bantaca spire. Ancient Bajoran
cities were built around them. They were all about eleven metres high,
made from hundreds of stones carved and fitted together so tightly they
didn't need mortar. <br>
KIRA: It's said they mark the city's place in the cosmos. <br>
DAX: Beautiful markings. <br>
SISKO: Supposedly, they're coordinates of the lost city. But because we
can't see the markings on the other two sides, they're impossible to
decipher. <br>
KIRA: Which is why B'hala is likely to remain lost. <br>
SISKO: Before you pack it up, have it scanned into the computer. <br>
(The Bajoran security guards nod.) <br>
DAX: You're going to study it? Maybe see if you can find the lost city?
<br>
KIRA: I was just thinking about Zocal's third prophecy. It said only
someone who had been touched by the Prophets could find the ruins of
B'hala. <br>
DAX: No pressure.

minor technical difficulty. <br>
ODO: No, but I can arrest you for negligence. Your own records show
your holosuites are in desperate need of maintenance. <br>
QUARK: Which is what I've been telling Chief O'Brien for the past week.
I begged him to have Rom fix them, but you know what he said? Rom's too
busy upgrading the sensor array. Can you believe that? Anyone can fix
the sensor array but no one can fix the holosuites like that idiot
brother of mine. So you see, if anyone should be arrested for
negligence, it's Chief O'Brien. <br>

me ask you something, does my uniform look any brighter to you? <br>
SISKO: Yes, everything does. Colours seem more intense and shapes more
focused. <br>
BASHIR: It's called post-neural shock syndrome. Your neural pathways
were overloaded by the plasma burst. All external stimuli are going to
seem more pronounced. It's going to take a while for things to settle
down though, so I'm going to put you on restricted duty for the next
three days. And if you experience any other side effects such as

QUARK: Never hurts. <br>
(Her glass also has the UFP logo on it.) <br>
DAX: I take it you think the Federation membership is going to be good
for business? <br>
QUARK: Of course it is. This station is going to get busier than an
Alvanian beehive. I'm expecting to do five times the volume in root
beer alone. You see, it's all about foot traffic. The more people come
in, the more they drink. The more they drink, the more they talk. The
more they talk, the more they let slip things that I shouldn't know,
And that, that always leads to latinum. <br>
WORF: Perhaps so. But there is one problem. <br>
QUARK: What's that? <br>
WORF: There is an ancient Klingon proverb that says, You cannot loosen
a man's tongue with root beer. <br>
KIRA: It is wonderful news, Vedek Mera. I'll see you at the signing
ceremony. Enjoying the celebration? <br>
DAX: As far as I'm concerned, the Federation should accept a new member
every week. <br>
WORF: And you, Major? Are you celebrating? <br>
KIRA: You know, five years ago I wouldn't have been. I didn't think
Federation membership was right for Bajor. It hadn't been that long
since the occupation and I thought it was important for us to learn to
stand on our own two feet. <br>
WORF: And what changed your mind? <br>
KIRA: A lot of things. My time on the station, my dealings with
Starfleet, but mostly the captain. <br>
DAX: He can be very persuasive. <br>
KIRA: No doubt about it. He made me a believer. <br>
DAX: Well I'll drink to that. <br>

ringing the temple chimes. <br>
KIRA: You were dreaming. <br>
SISKO: No, I was there. I could smell the burning bateret leaves, taste
the incense on the wind. I was standing in front of the obelisk and as
I looked up, for one moment I understood it all. B'hala, the Orbs, the
occupation, the discovery of the wormhole, the coming war with the
Dominion. <br>
KIRA: You could see the future as well as the past? <br>
SISKO: For one moment, I could see the pattern that held it all
together. <br>
KIRA: You were having a pagh'tem'far, a sacred vision. <br>
SISKO: Hell, I don't know what I had, but it felt wonderful. <br>
KIRA: The Prophets chose well when they made you their Emissary. So how
does it all fit together? <br>
SISKO: I wish I knew. Someone woke me up. <br>
KIRA: I was worried about you. <br>

I'd be worried about you, too. <br>

my apologies. Tell the Kai that I am busy today but I'll meet with her

WINN: I'm sure the Federation is very pleased with the job he's done. <br>
KIRA: I thought everyone was. <br>
(They set off along the corridor, slowly.) <br>
WINN: Well, not everyone. You know, our culture has had only five short
years to recover from the occupation. Only five years of freedom. It
hardly seems enough time, does it? <br>
KIRA: Well, Bajor's still going to be free. Joining the Federation
isn't going to change that. <br>
WINN: I see working beside Captain Sisko all these years has had quite
an influence on you. <br>
KIRA: I have to give you credit. You just never give up. I'm sure the
Emissary will consider everything you have to say, and then Bajor's
admittance can go forward unobstructed. <br>

fought the Cardassians, that you saved Bajor singlehandedly. Perhaps
you forget, Major, the Cardassians arrested any Bajoran they found
teaching the word of the Prophets. I was in a Cardassian prison camp

WHATLEY: Well, that wasn't so bad, was it? <br>
KIRA: Captain? <br>
SISKO: Cardassia. <br>
KIRA: Sir? <br>
SISKO: That's where it was going. The cloud. <br>
WHATLEY: What cloud? <br>
SISKO: I was on Bajor. B'hala had been rebuilt. The people were in the
streets, celebrating. But then a shadow covered the sun. We looked up
and saw a cloud filling the sky. It was a swarm of locusts, billions of
them. They hovered over the city, the noise was deafening, but just as
quickly as they came, they moved on. Now I know where they were going.
Cardassia. <br>
KIRA: What do you think it means? <br>
SISKO: I don't know. <br>
KIRA: At least the swarm was moving away from Bajor. That's a good
sign. Isn't it? <br>
SISKO: But what do these locusts represent? And why Cardassia? <br>
WHATLEY: You were dreaming. And dreams don't always make sense. <br>
SISKO: This was no a dream. <br>
BASHIR: Captain, why didn't you tell me about these headaches of yours?
<br>
SISKO: I guess I was too busy. <br>
BASHIR: Well, if you'd stayed busy much longer you could have died. The
area of unusual neural activity has increased another eight percent. As
a result, your basal ganglia are starting to depolarise. I'm going to
have to operate, try to repolarise your neural sheaths. <br>
SISKO: How will that affect my visions? <br>
WHATLEY: That's not really the issue here, is it? <br>
SISKO: It is to me. Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Well, there's no way to tell for sure. But I assume if I can
complete the procedure, your brain activity will return to normal and
the visions will stop. <br>
SISKO: Then you can't do it. <br>
WHATLEY: Ben, that's ridiculous. <br>
BASHIR: If I don't operate, sir, you could die. <br>
SISKO: I understand that. But something is happening to me. Something
extraordinary. I have to see it through.

KASIDY: I cannot believe what I'm hearing. Listen to yourself, Ben.
Sitting there, telling us that this mystical journey of yours is more
important than watching your son grow up. <br>
JAKE: Dad, please think about what you're doing. These visions, they're
not worth dying for. <br>
SISKO: I remember the first time I held you in my hands. You were only
a few minutes old and when I looked down at your face, it was almost as
if I could see your whole life stretched out in front of you. All the
joys it would bring, and the bruises. It was all there, hidden in that
scrunched up little face. The baby that I'm holding in my hands now is
the universe itself. And I need time to study its face. <br>
KASIDY: Look at the face of your son now and then tell me you're doing
the right thing. <br>

SISKO: Come in. <br>
WINN: It's time, Emissary, if you're ready. <br>
SISKO: I am. <br>

going to survive this. <br>
KIRA: The Captain is not going to die. He is the Emissary. The Prophets
will take care of him. <br>
O'BRIEN: With all due respect, Major, I'd rather see Julian take care
of him. <br>
KIRA: Chief, I know you're worried, but the Prophets are leading the
Emissary on this path for a reason. <br>
WORF: Do not attempt to convince them, Major. They cannot understand. <br>
DAX: Since when did you believe in the Prophets? <br>
WORF: What I believe in is faith. Without it there can be no victory.
If the Captain's faith is strong, he will prevail. <br>
DAX: That's not much to bet his life on. <br>
KIRA: You're wrong. It's everything. <br>

(A vicious headache hits him.) <br>
WINN: The Orb of Prophecy is very powerful. It taxes even the healthy.
Are you sure you want to go through with this? <br>
SISKO: I have to. I need to bring the visions into focus, tie them
together. I can't do it alone. <br>
WINN: But you're very weak. Perhaps it would be better to wait until
after the signing. <br>

WHATLEY: How long do these Orb experiences last? <br>
WINN: Minutes. Hours. Sometimes days. <br>
WHATLEY: Then maybe we shouldn't wait for him. Do you have any
objections to proceeding without Captain Sisko? <br>
WINN: I'm sure the Emissary would want to be here, but under the
circumstances. <br>
WHATLEY: May I have your attention. I've been looking forward to this
day for many years, as I'm sure all of you have. Welcoming a new planet
to the Federation is the happiest assignment an Admiral could hope for.
The Federation is not just a union of planets, it's much more. <br>

you? <br>
SISKO: Locusts. They'll destroy Bajor unless it stands alone. <br>
WHATLEY: Ben, what the hell are you talking about? <br>
SISKO: It's too soon! Bajor must not join the Federation. If it does,
it will be destroyed. <br>

Sisko. And he told us he doesn't want anything interfering with his

in agreement here that they are not as important as Captain Sisko's
life. Start the procedures. <br>
BASHIR: It's not that simple. Captain Sisko refused surgery and I can't
go against the decision of my patient. Not without the express consent
of his closest relative. <br>

KIRA: He's an eighteen year-old boy who doesn't want to lose his
father. What would you have done in his place? <br>
WINN: I would trust the Prophets. <br>
KIRA: Maybe we're the ones who need to trust the Prophets. For all we
know, this is part of their plan. Maybe they've told Captain Sisko
everything they want him to know. <br>
WINN: Perhaps. I suppose you heard that Bajor will not join the
Federation today. The Council of Ministers has voted to delay
acceptance of Federation membership. <br>

membership. <br>
SISKO: I can't do that. The visions may have faded, but everything I
said, everything I did, still feels right. When I said that Bajor
should wait before it joins the Federation, I have never felt so
certain about anything in my life. <br>
