<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Doctor Nydrom, how's our muon charge? <br>
NYDROM: Coming up to full power. <br>
BASHIR: Go ahead, please. <br>
(A woman puts a cylinder of orange stuff into the central machine -
think Tardis console) <br>
BASHIR: Computer, this is harvester test sequence three hundred and
seventy five. <br>
NYDROM: Muon generator now at full power. <br>
BASHIR: Once more unto the breach. I hope this works, because quite
frankly I'm running out of ideas. <br>
NYDROM: It took ten years to perfect the harvesters. We've only been
trying to eliminate them for a week. <br>
BASHIR: Is that all it's been? It feels like we've been working more
than a month. I've never seen a nanobiogenic weapon so resistant to
broad spectrum radiation. It's just a matter of finding the right
combination of muon frequencies. It should be simple, but it's not. <br>
O'BRIEN: Doctor, start the sequence or we will be here a month. <br>
BASHIR: All right, Chief. I'm introducing the harvester into the
genetic bath. Beginning muon influx now. <br>
(The stuff comes out green) <br>
BASHIR: Doctor, please check for any gene-disrupter phasing. <br>
NYDROM: The genetic integrity of the sample is holding steady. I'm not
reading any genetic disruption at all. <br>
BASHIR: Are you sure? Check the sequence again. <br>
NYDROM: The results are identical. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? It worked, didn't it? Would somebody say something? <br>
BASHIR: It worked all right. <br>
NYDROM: The harvesters have been destroyed. <br>
(Sharat enters - a different race to Nydrom) <br>
SHARAT: Good news, I take it. <br>
NYDROM: Ambassador Sharat, I'm pleased to inform you that we have found
a way to eliminate the harvesters. <br>
SHARAT: Excellent. Well done. I knew if our people stopped killing each
other and worked together, we could put an end to these horrible
weapons. This is a symbol of the new future we have embarked upon. <br>
NYDROM: Yes. And let's not forget, we couldn't have done it without the
help of our friends from the Federation. <br>
SHARAT: At first we had questioned Doctor Nydrom's decision to bring in
outside help. Obviously it was the right thing to do. We're all very
grateful for your assistance. <br>
BASHIR: It was our pleasure, I assure you. <br>
SHARAT: But eliminating the harvesters is only half the task. We must
make certain all scientific data concerned with them is wiped out as
well. <br>
O'BRIEN: I've purged every file in the T'Lani and Kellerun data banks
pertaining to harvesters. If anyone gets it in their head to build
these things again, they'll have to start from scratch. <br>
NYDROM: Then it's finished. <br>
SHARAT: Not quite. We shouldn't rest until the entire Kellerun and
T'Lani supply of harvesters has been destroyed. <br>
BASHIR: We will begin immediately. <br>

SISKO: I've already heard. <br>
BASHIR [on monitor]: You have? <br>
SISKO: Yes. I received a message from both the T'Lani and Kellerun
ambassadors, informing me of your success in neutralising the
harvesters. Congratulations, gentlemen. <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: Thank you, sir, but Doctor here deserves the bulk
of the credit. <br>
BASHIR [on monitor]: Actually, it was a team effort <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: The Doctor's just being modest, sir. He was the
one who came up with muon rays as a possible solution. <br>
BASHIR [on monitor]: Luckily, it worked. <br>
SISKO: When can we expect you back? <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: Soon, I hope. <br>
SISKO: The ambassador said something about a celebration on T'Lani
Prime. <br>
BASHIR [on monitor]: Yes, it's set for tonight, but the Chief is quite
anxious to return back to the station. <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: It's been a long week. <br>
SISKO: Still, I think we can spare you for another day. <br>
BASHIR [on monitor]: I agree. If that's okay with you, Chief. <br>

should have the honour, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: My pleasure. <br>
NYDROM: It's ironic, isn't it, that the war would finally come to an
end up here, above T'Lani Three, a planet whose entire population was
decimated by harvesters. I hope this will be a lasting peace. <br>
(Two armed men from the same race as Sharat enter) <br>
NYDROM: What is this? Weapons aren't allowed up here. <br>
(He gets shot. Everyone dives for cover as the gunfire continues. The
scientists are massacred, O'Brien tackles the one about to shoot Bashir
and gets his weapon. Bashir goes for the other one, and a shot blows up
the console with the harvester cylinder in it. A drop of stuff lands on
O'Brien's arm. Bashir knocks the man out and they check the others.
O'Brien locks down the doors.) <br>
BASHIR: They're all dead. <br>
O'BRIEN: We will be, too, if we don't get out of here. O'Brien to
Ganges. Computer, activate remote transporter sequence. O'Brien to
Ganges. <br>
BASHIR: They must be jamming communications with the runabout. <br>
(Weapons fire on the other side of the door.) <br>
O'BRIEN: We sure as hell can't stay here. We'll have to beam down to
the surface. <br>
BASHIR: But they'll be able to follow us. <br>

transport. Let's go. </font></p>

<br>
E'TYSHRA: (female, same race as Nydrom) Along with some of our greatest
scientists. <br>
SHARAT: We're sorry you had to share in our misfortune. <br>
SISKO: What happened? <br>
E'TYSHRA: It was <br>
SHARAT: It was a terrible accident. It appears one of your officers, a
Chief O'Brien I believe, inadvertently tripped a security device. A
lethal pulse of radiation flooded the room, killing everyone. <br>
E'TYSHRA: Ambassador Sharat transported off the ship just minutes
before the accident occurred. <br>
SISKO: This security device <br>
E'TYSHRA: It was built into the lab's computers decades ago. We didn't
even know it existed. <br>
SISKO: If there were no survivors, how do you know that Chief O'Brien
caused the accident? <br>
SHARAT: I was able to return to the ship almost immediately after the
accident. The first thing I did was to check the internal security
sensors. They recorded the entire incident. We assumed you'd want to
see for yourself. <br>
SISKO: Thank you. <br>
E'TYSHRA: Commander, I just want you to know we don't blame Chief
O'Brien for what happened. <br>
SHARAT: On the contrary, both he and Doctor Bashir will always be
considered heroes to both the Kellerun and the T'Lani. Without their
help, we never could have destroyed the harvesters. <br>
E'TYSHRA: Please extend our sympathies to their families. <br>
SISKO: I'll do that.

horizontal slits for windows and good structural bracing. It also has
barrels and boxes.) <br>
BASHIR: Chief! Chief, in here. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wait. Don't touch anything. <br>
BASHIR: Why not? There's food and medical supplies. <br>
O'BRIEN: They could be booby-trapped. The Cardassians used to rig the
supplies they left behind with pressure grenades. I've seen more than
one soldier permanently lose his appetite that way. <br>
BASHIR: Well, did you find anything? <br>
O'BRIEN: It looks all right. <br>
BASHIR: Good. At least we won't starve. Here. <br>
O'BRIEN: No. <br>
BASHIR: Why not, Chief? I thought you loved military rations. <br>
O'BRIEN: Federation rations. I've had enough T'Lani food this past week
to last me a lifetime. <br>
BASHIR: Well, we've got to keep our strength up. We're going to have to
find some way of warning the T'Lani the Kelleruns have broken the
treaty. <br>
O'BRIEN: I still can't figure it. Why would the Kelleruns wait till the
harvesters were destroyed before they made their move? <br>
BASHIR: Maybe they didn't ha d over all the harvesters for destruction.
<br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe they're convinced they can defeat the T'Lani with
conventional weapons. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose, but that might mean continuing the war for another
hundred years. Well, whatever the reason, we'd better keep moving. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wait. Listen to me, Julian. The Kelleruns are going to expect
us to be on the move. If we start running, their sensors'll pick us up
before we've gone a kilometre. If we stay still maybe, just maybe,
it'll take them longer to find us. The way I see it, we have only one
chance to survive this thing that's to stay alive long enough for
Commander Sisko to find us. <br>
BASHIR: But that won't be for at least another day. He still thinks
we're celebrating on T'Lani Prime. <br>
O'BRIEN: I said it was our only chance, I didn't say it was a good one.
(some computer equipment) What have we here? Looks like some kind of
comm. system. Maybe we can contact the T'Lani from here. <br>
BASHIR: Do you think you can get it working? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll have to open it up, see if there's a backup power supply.
Why don't you take a seat, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: I thought maybe I could help. I took the engineering extension
courses at Starfleet Medical. <br>
O'BRIEN: Extension courses? <br>
BASHIR: They were actually quite informative. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, do you really want to help? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
O'BRIEN: Then let me do my job. <br>

the original operating system. I can't shut it down. Do you know
anything about this? <br>
NYDROM [on screen]: No. Maybe you should try cutting the power. <br>

vaporises any intruder who doesn't enter the proper code. <br>
KIRA: I'm surprised the Chief didn't detect it. <br>
DAX: It must've been buried very deep in the system. <br>
KIRA: I'd like to talk to the chief of security for that ship. <br>
ODO: So would I. <br>
SISKO: Remember, they lost people too. <br>
KIRA: The T'Lani were responsible for O'Brien's and Bashir's safety.
They should have known about that device and deactivated it. <br>
SISKO: That'll do, Major. I'd like for you to contact Bajoran medical
officials. We'll need a doctor to be temporarily assigned to the
station until Starfleet can send us a replacement for Doctor Bashir.
Dax, inform Starfleet of the accident. Tell them we'll need a new
medical officer and a new chief of operations. <br>
DAX: Would you like me to go with you to see Mrs O'Brien? <br>
SISKO: No, I'll take care of it. Find out how I can contact Julian's
family. Major, inform the crew we'll be holding a memorial service
tomorrow evening at eighteen hundred hours. <br>

for. You know, I was looking forward to the celebrations on T'Lani
Prime. I don't know if you'd noticed, but T'Lani women are quite
attractive. <br>

BASHIR: Of course not. But you are married. <br>
O'BRIEN: Just because you're married doesn't mean you stop looking at
women. <br>
BASHIR: Just as long as you don't let your wife see you look. For me,
tonight's celebrations would have been an adventure. The most you could
have hoped for was a good meal. <br>
O'BRIEN: Women. That's all you ever think about <br>
BASHIR: No, it isn't. Though I do think about them a lot. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, well, one of these days you'll fall in love with one. <br>
BASHIR: I did once. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not work out? <br>

seem fair. <br>

BASHIR: Fair to them. I mean, look at us. Our lives are constantly in
danger. There's enough to worry about without worrying about the wife
and kids at home worrying about us. I'm sorry, Chief. I just feel that
way. A lot of career officers feel that way. <br>

have good arches. She was gorgeous, not to mention brilliant. I used to
watch her on stage. I couldn't believe how anyone could be so graceful.
<br>
O'BRIEN: And she was crazy about you? <br>
BASHIR: We were crazy about each other. I used to think, Julian, you
lucky devil. You've found the perfect woman. We used to finish each
other's thoughts. There. (the component) What do you think? <br>
O'BRIEN: Good, good. Put it back in the comm. panel. <br>
(Lights flicker as it comes to life.) <br>
BASHIR: Looks like we have some power, anyway. Still no response from
the transmitter, though. <br>
O'BRIEN: Try retuning the RF oscillators. So what happened with you and
Palis? <br>
BASHIR: What happened is I graduated. Her father was the top
administrator at a medical complex in Paris. He offered me a job,
promised I'd be Chief of Surgery within five years <br>
O'BRIEN: But you would have to give up your Starfleet career. <br>
BASHIR: I can't tell you how close I came. But, here I am. <br>
O'BRIEN: You made your choice. <br>
BASHIR: Yeah. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I
think to myself, will I ever find anyone that wonderful again? The
oscillator's working, but the frequency is still fluctuating. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let me take a look. Argh. <br>
BASHIR: What is it? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's my legs. I can't feel them.

SISKO: Open a channel to the T'Lani cruiser. <br>
E'TYSHRA [on monitor]: Commander Sisko. What a pleasant surprise. I
take it you're here for your runabout? <br>
SISKO: That's correct. <br>
E'TYSHRA [on monitor]: We were about to leave for the memorial service
on T'Lani Prime. You're welcome to accompany us. <br>
SISKO: Perhaps we will. But first I'd like to see for myself where the
accident took place. <br>
E'TYSHRA [on monitor]: Of course. <br>
DAX: While you're on the cruiser, I think I'll beam over to the Ganges

very faint <br>
O'BRIEN: You'll have to switch to a higher carrier frequency. Reset the
actuators on the chamber's coil. <br>
BASHIR: That's better. It's still pretty weak though. I'm sending a
distress signal. It's set to repeat every two minutes. Let's hope the
T'Lani find us before the Kellerun do. <br>
O'BRIEN: They'd better get here soon. <br>
BASHIR: Don't worry, Chief I'm going to get you home. <br>
O'BRIEN: In a box, maybe. <br>
BASHIR: Nonsense. Don't go giving up on me now. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not giving up, I'm dying. Listen to me, Julian. You must
tell Keiko and Molly <br>
BASHIR: You'll tell them yourself. <br>
O'BRIEN: You were wrong, you know, about marriage. <br>
BASHIR: Whatever you say, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Listen to me, Julian. You're always talking about adventure.
Ha, adventure! Marriage is the greatest adventure of them all. It's
filled with pitfalls and setbacks and mistakes, but it's a journey
worth taking because you take it together. I know Keiko's been unhappy
about us coming to the station. We still argue about it. But that's all
right, because at the end of the day, we both know we love each other. <br>
BASHIR: Chief. <br>

E'TYSHRA: That's to be expected, given the pulse's intensity, but it
poses no danger. <br>
SISKO: Tell me, Ambassador. Have you been able to learn any thing else
about the fail-safe device that caused the accident? <br>
E'TYSHRA: Not yet, Commander, but we're working on it. <br>
SISKO: It was Ambassador Sharat who brought you the data clip? <br>
E'TYSHRA: That's right. <br>
SISKO: I suppose he showed it to you as soon as you arrived? <br>
E'TYSHRA: Of course. <br>
SISKO: Could the clip have been altered before you saw it? <br>
E'TYSHRA: Why would Ambassador Sharat alter the data clip? <br>
SISKO: I have no idea. <br>

DAX [OC]: Commander, when you're through there, could you join me on
the Ganges? <br>

That peace cannot survive unless both sides trust each other. </font></p>

SISKO: What have you got, Dax? <br>
DAX: It looks like someone erased five seconds from the Ganges's
computer log. <br>
SISKO: Show me. <br>
DAX: At first I thought it was just some kind of power fluctuation, but
when I checked the log's memory core it showed traces of a remote
transport command. <br>
SISKO: Did you find any indication of transporter activity at that
time? <br>
DAX: No. <br>
SISKO: And you're saying somebody erased it later on? <br>
DAX: Look at the time index when the call for transport came in. <br>
SISKO: Fifteen thirty four. That's a full three minutes after the
accident on the T'Lani cruiser. <br>
DAX: Which means if either Chief O'Brien or Julian made that request <br>
SISKO: They would've been alive after the fail-safe device went off.
Good work, Lieutenant.

(Footsteps outside, then E'Tyshra enters) <br>
BASHIR: Ambassador E'Tyshra, am I glad to see you. Chief O'Brien was
infected by the harvesters when the Kelleruns attacked your ship. They
killed all of the scientists. <br>

SHARAT: Not all of them. <br>
BASHIR: You're too late, Sharat. <br>
E'TYSHRA: No, Doctor. He's right on time. <br>
BASHIR: But why kill Nydrom and the others? <br>
E'TYSHRA: To ensure that the peace agreement between our two races will
last. <br>
BASHIR: But we'd already destroyed the harvesters. There was no reason
for more killings, unless <br>
SHARAT: It's not enough to simply destroy the harvesters. We have to be
sure no one can ever recreate them. <br>
E'TYSHRA: The only way to do that was to eliminate everyone who
possessed such knowledge, including the two of you. <br>
BASHIR: But we have no use for such horrible weapons. <br>
SHARAT: As long as the knowledge exists, there's a danger it may be
used. That's a risk we refuse to live with. <br>
E'TYSHRA: I truly am sorry, Doctor, but at least you have the
consolation of knowing your deaths will be for a noble cause. <br>

BASHIR: He was exposed to the harvesters. That should stabilise him for
now. <br>
DAX: They told us you were both dead, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: We would have been, if the T'Lani and Kelleruns had had their
way. They're killing everyone involved in the harvesters project. <br>
DAX: The T'Lani cruiser's coming this way. They're hailing us. <br>
SISKO: Ignore them. Send a general distress signal on all Federation

DAX: They're blocking all subspace communications with a broadband

you, but we must insist you turn over Doctor Bashir and Chief O'Brien. <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: Why? So you can murder them? <br>
SHARAT: Unfortunately, Commander, your officers are the only two people
left who've seen the data concerning the development of the harvesters.

us to order the deaths of our own people, but it is necessary. <br>
