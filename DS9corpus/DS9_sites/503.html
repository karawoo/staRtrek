KIRA: Welcome to Deep Space Nine. I'm Major Kira. <br>
DULMUR: I'm Dulmur. <br>
(An anagram of Muldur, and yes - ) <br>
LUCSLY: Lucsly. Department of Temporal Investigations. <br>
KIRA: We've been expecting you. <br>
DAX: I guess you boys from Temporal Investigations are always on time. <br>
DULMUR: Where's Captain Sisko?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Are you sure you don't want anything? <br>
DULMUR: Just the truth, Captain. <br>
SISKO: You'll get it. Where do you want to start? <br>
DULMUR: The beginning. <br>
LUCSLY: If there is such a thing. <br>
DULMUR: Captain, why did you take the Defiant back in time? <br>
SISKO: It was an accident. <br>
LUCSLY: So you're not contending it was a predestination paradox? <br>
DULMUR: A time loop. That you were meant to go back into the past? <br>
SISKO: Erm, no. <br>
DULMUR: Good. <br>
LUCSLY: We hate those. So, what happened? <br>
SISKO: This may take some time. <br>
DULMUR: Is that a joke? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
LUCSLY: Good. <br>
DULMUR: We hate those too. All right, Captain. Whenever you're ready. <br>
SISKO: Two weeks ago the Cardassian Government contacted me and wanted
to return an Orb to the Bajorans. <br>
DULMUR: Orb? <br>
LUCSLY: They're devices of alien origin that are considered sacred
objects by the Bajoran people. <br>
SISKO: Each has a unique property, like the Orb of Prophecy, or the Orb
of Wisdom. The one we received from the Cardassians was the Orb of
Time, although we didn't know that at first. <br>
SISKO [OC]: When the Defiant arrived at Cardassia Prime, we weren't
sure if we were dealing with a genuine Orb or one of the fakes that
have cropped up over the years.

WADDLE: Humans! I never thought I'd see another normal face again. <br>
WORF: This is Mister Waddle. <br>
WADDLE: Barry. Call me Barry. <br>
WORF: We are taking him back to the Federation. He was trapped on
Cardassia when the Klingons attacked. <br>
WADDLE: I'm a merchant. I deal in gemstones, kivas and trillium mostly.
May I? <br>
O'BRIEN: Help yourself. <br>
WADDLE: You know what Cardassians drink in the morning? Fish juice. Hot
fish juice. Raktajino. After six months, I was hoping the Klingons
would invade. At least they know how to make coffee, even if they are
foul-smelling barbarians. Sorry. <br>
O'BRIEN: I wouldn't take it personally, Worf. <br>
BASHIR: I rather like the way you smell. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, sort of earthy, peaty aroma. <br>
BASHIR: With a touch of lilac.

Cardassian space and managed to avoid being detected by the Klingons.
We were halfway home, and I was just starting to breath easy. <br>
O'BRIEN: Trust me. Next time you see him, just sniff the air and go 'is
that lilac?' <br>
DAX: Find somebody else. I have my own ways of torturing Worf. <br>
SISKO: Don't look at me. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm picking up a massive surge in chronoton radiation around <br>

DAX: I don't know, but we've dropped out of warp. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sensors are coming back online. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, something's very wrong. According to the navigational
computer we're over two hundred light years from our last position. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're decloaking! <br>
DAX: Someone's activated the transporter. <br>
SISKO: Deactivate it and get us back under cloak. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm picking up another ship dead ahead. <br>

There've been five. <br>
LUCSLY: Six. <br>

LUCSLY: James T Kirk. <br>
SISKO: The one and only. <br>
LUCSLY: Seventeen separate temporal violations. The biggest file on

DULMUR: The man was a menace. What was the date of your arrival? <br>
SISKO: Stardate 4523.7. <br>
DULMUR: A hundred and five years, one month, and twelve days ago. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO [OC]: She was orbiting one of the old Deep
Space stations. K-seven, near the Klingon border. Security reported
that just before we were thrown back in time, someone stunned the
deputy who was guarding the orb and broke into the cabin. It didn't
take us long to realise who it was.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mess hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: His real name is Arne Darvin. He is a Klingon
altered to look human. <br>
DAX: His surgeon does nice work. <br>
ODO: We're assuming that he came aboard the Defiant for the express
purpose of gaining access to the Orb. <br>
O'BRIEN: Any idea why he brought us back to this point in time? <br>
WORF: We have a theory. This is Darvin as he appeared during that time
period. At this moment he is aboard space station K-seven, posing as a
Federation official. <br>
BASHIR: So you're saying he's a spy? <br>
ODO: The younger Darvin's mission was to derail Federation colonisation
efforts by poisoning a shipment of grain which was, which is being
stored aboard the station. However, eighteen hours from now, James Kirk
will expose him and he will be arrested. <br>
(That's the plot of <a href="../StarTrek/42.htm"> Trouble
with Tribbles</a>, so here's the link for
you. Now, let's just enjoy our 30th anniversary Trek show.) <br>
WORF: That arrest will end his career. Klingon Intelligence will turn
their back on him and he will become an outcast. <br>
ODO: From what we've been able to piece together, he spent the next
hundred years eking out a meager living posing as a human merchant.
Then in a final indignity, he was trapped in Cardassian space by the
Klingon invasion. <br>
SISKO: Ah. Until he heard rumours about an Orb capable of taking him
back in time. <br>
BASHIR: So what's he planning to do? Contact his younger self and warn
himself about Kirk? <br>
DAX: He could be planning to kill Kirk. <br>
SISKO: The bottom line is, we have to find Darvin and stop him before
he has a chance to alter history. Do we know where he beamed to? <br>
WORF: No. He wiped the transporter logs when he beamed out. <br>
O'BRIEN: So he could be on the Enterprise or the station. <br>
SISKO: We'll have to search both without arousing suspicion or altering
the timeline ourselves. The last thing I want is a visit from Temporal
Investigations when we get home. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose we ought to find a way to blend in. <br>
(So uniforms are changed and Dax's spots are 'removed'. Old style
tricorders and communicators, and a beehive hairstyle.)

SISKO: Thank you, Ensign. <br>
BASHIR: Wait a minute, aren't you two wearing the wrong colour? <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't you know anything about this period in time? <br>
BASHIR: I'm a doctor, not an historian. <br>
SISKO: In the old days, operations officers wore red, command officers
wore gold. <br>
DAX: And women wore less. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: The original Enterprise used an old-style
duotronic sensor array. If we wait for just the right point in the scan
cycle, we can decloak the Defiant for almost three seconds without
being detected. <br>
SISKO: Is that enough time to transport us aboard? <br>
O'BRIEN: Barely. <br>
DAX: Chief, here are the coordinates. The Captain and I will start on
deck four and work our way aft. You and Julian should start on deck
twenty one <br>
O'BRIEN: And work our way forward. <br>
SISKO: What about the station? <br>
WORF: Little of it is habitable. Most of K seven consists of storage
areas and industrial fabrication facilities. <br>
ODO: It shouldn't take long to search. Security isn't as tight as it is
on a starship. <br>
SISKO: Remember, try to avoid contact with people of this time period. <br>

WORF: A tribble. <br>
ODO: Sit down. You're drawing attention. <br>
WORF: Where did you get that thing? <br>

but this one doesn't seem to like you. <br>
WORF: The feeling's! The feeling's mutual. They are detestable
creatures. <br>
ODO: Interesting. It's been my observation that most humanoids love
soft, furry animals especially if they make pleasing sounds. <br>
WORF: They do nothing but consume food and breed. If you feed that
thing more than the smallest morsel, in a few hours you'll have ten
tribbles then a hundred then a thousand. <br>
ODO: Calm down. <br>
WORF: They were once considered mortal enemies of the Klingon Empire. <br>

WORF: They were an ecological menace, a plague to be wiped out. <br>
ODO: Wiped out? What are you saying? <br>
WORF: Hundreds of warriors were sent to track them down throughout the
galaxy. An armada obliterated the Tribbles' homeworld. By the end of
the twenty third century they had been eradicated. <br>

still sing songs of the great tribble hunt? <br>

bit interested in meeting one of the most famous men in Starfleet
history? <br>
SISKO: We have a job to do. <br>
DAX: But it's, it's James Kirk! <br>
SISKO: Look, of course I want to meet him. I'd like to shake his hand,
ask him about fighting the

DAX: You're right. I guess the difference between you and me is I
