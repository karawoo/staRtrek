<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Upstairs, an older woman is being wined by a
younger man) <br>
ALSIA: When my husband was alive, we ran the business together, and I
managed to put away a bit of latinum every year just for myself. Now
he's gone, well, I've got quite a little sum. <br>
MARTUS: That's important. <br>
ALSIA: Well, to be honest, it's not enough. Not for the future. Not for
the way I want to live out my retirement. So, I've decided to invest it
all. I can't believe I'm telling you this. I just met you but I
feel like I can really trust you. It's like I've known you forever. <br>
MARTUS: When hearts are in sympathy, time collapses. <br>
ALSIA: I'm taking everything I've saved and I'm purchasing the mining
concession on the entire Vlugta asteroid belt. <br>
(Odo is coming up the stairs) <br>
MARTUS: How ambitious. And such an adventurous undertaking for a woman
of your delicate sensibilities. Are you sure that's wise? Prospecting
can be risky. <br>
ALSIA: Not this time. My father was a stellar cartographer. Thirty
years ago, he conducted a full spectrum mineral analysis of those
asteroids but he never had the means to follow up on what he found. <br>
MARTUS: And now you plan to carry out your father's dream. <br>
ALSIA: When his survey results become public, I'll get seven times my
investment back overnight. I still can't believe I'm telling you this.
My secret plan. I've been thinking about it for years. I never even
told my husband. It must be all this Gamzian wine. <br>
MARTUS: How brave of you to do all of this on your own. <br>
ALSIA: It hasn't been easy. There's so much to keep track of, so much
to do. <br>
MARTUS: Maybe I could help. Would you consider some kind of
partnership? <br>
(Odo puts his hand on Martus' shoulder) <br>
ODO: Let's go. <br>
MARTUS: Exactly where are we going? <br>
ODO: To Security. <br>
MARTUS: But I've done nothing wrong. <br>
ALSIA: It's true. We were just talking. <br>
ODO: You were talking, madam. He was listening. <br>
(And Martus is hauled away)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTUS: Security Chief Odo, isn't it? <br>
ODO: I've been watching you ever since you arrived. <br>
MARTUS: Should I be flattered? <br>
ODO: Martus Mazur, a refuge from the El-Aurian system. <br>
MARTUS: Well, everyone has to be from somewhere. Where are you from,
Odo? <br>
ODO: Don't pull that routine on me. <br>
MARTUS: What routine? <br>
ODO: I know all about you El-Aurians. You're listeners. People like to
talk to you. <br>
MARTUS: Everyone has to have someone to confide in, someone to hear
their stories I offer a sympathetic ear. And if they request my help I
give it to them. <br>
ODO: That couple from Pythro Five told me you asked for their financial
access codes. <br>
MARTUS: Some might call helping an elderly couple invest their savings
a compassionate act. <br>
ODO: Not when you invest it in your own business. A business that
promptly folds. <br>
MARTUS: I had a run of bad luck. No one regrets it more than I do. <br>
ODO: You're a con man. And they've signed a complaint.

racquet, and Bashir is there in a snazzy one-piece doing fancy
exercises) <br>
BASHIR: Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Hello, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Great job. You built it yourself, didn't you? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah. Just finished. I missed playing and I figured there'd be
at least a couple of other players on board. I didn't think you'd be
one of them. <br>
BASHIR Captain of the team at Starfleet Medical Academy. We took the
sector championships in my final year. <br>
O'BRIEN: Against other medical students? <br>
BASHIR: Against everybody. Played a Vulcan in the finals. Talk about
stamina. I don't think he ever actually broke a sweat. <br>
O'BRIEN: And you won? <br>
BASHIR: Took him on a back wall riser shot. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I can't say I've had much in the way of formal training
myself, but it's been a serious pastime for a lot of years. <br>
BASHIR: Some of the toughest players I've come up against didn't really
know what they were doing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Really. <br>
BASHIR: Formally I mean. Hey, whatever works, works. This exercise for
example, I picked up at a tournament from a top player. It's a five
thousand year
old battle warm-up. According to the legend, it makes the heart a
friend to the hand. Medically, I don't
really know what that means, but it seems to give me a lot of energy.
Fancy a game? <br>
O'BRIEN: Serve. <br>
BASHIR: I guess from the lines you prefer the old style rules. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can play any style you like. <br>
BASHIR: Traditional it is, then. Always been my personal favourite. <br>
O'BRIEN: Serve! <br>
(Thump, bounce, bounce, bounce off the walls and O'Brien doesn't even
see the ball) <br>
BASHIR: One. </font></p>

MARTUS: Pardon me, friend. Pardon me! <br>
(Martus nudges the shelf to shut him up and it works) <br>
MARTUS: Friend? Friend, re you all right? <br>
(Grunt and he wakes up. My husband does that too) <br>
MARTUS: I thought you'd died. <br>
COS: If only I could be so fortunate. <br>
MARTUS: You were snoring. <br>
COS: Please accept my apologies. I didn't mean to disturb you, but as
you can see, my health is not so good. <br>
MARTUS: Yes, well, I'm sorry I had to wake you. <br>
COS: I wasn't always like this. <br>
MARTUS: Of course not. <br>
COS: I had youth, vigour, fame, wealth beyond measure. All gone. <br>
MARTUS: I'm not listening. <br>
COS: All because of this. <br>
(A purple sphere with flashing lights.) <br>
MARTUS: A gambling device? (it stops flashing) Did you win? <br>
COS: Of course not. <br>
MARTUS: You gambled away everything you had? <br>
COS: In a manner of speaking. Every trade deal I struck was a disaster.
Every alliance I formed fell apart. Every endeavour backed, a failure. <br>
MARTUS: But what does this have to do with the toy? Sounds like you
just had a lot of rotten luck. <br>
COS: Yes. Rotten luck. In the end It all comes down to luck. (plays the
game again) I won! <br>
MARTUS: That's nice. What did you win? <br>
(Cos is slumped against the wall with a look of blissful peace on his
face. Martus takes the sphere.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEIKO: How'd it go? <br>
(A very sweaty O'Brien slams down his racquet and slumps onto the
settee) <br>
KEIKO: Good workout? <br>
O'BRIEN: Medical school. Captain of the team at Medical school. <br>
KEIKO: Who are you talking about? <br>
O'BRIEN: Bashir. <br>
KEIKO: You had a game? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, he had a game. I just kind of stumbled around the court
for ninety minutes and made a complete ass of myself. <br>
KEIKO: I'm sure he didn't see it that way. <br>
O'BRIEN: The hell he didn't. That smug look on his face. I guess you
prefer old style rules. Like I was some kind of a fossil. In my day, I
could've wiped the court with him. <br>
KEIKO: That's the point. You're not a kid anymore. It's nothing to be
ashamed of. People just naturally slow down. <br>
O'BRIEN: Like molasses in winter, huh? Thanks. <br>
KEIKO: Miles, you're taking this way too seriously. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm out of shape, that's all. I just need to get my wind back.
Sector Champion, my eye. He's vulnerable to every one of my best shots.
I just couldn't get them there. This time. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I thought he was going to have a heart
attack. <br>
DAX: Come on, Julian. It couldn't have been that bad. <br>
BASHIR: No, really. His face was flushed. I could've taken his pulse
just watching the side of his neck. <br>
DAX: Why didn't you stop it? <br>
BASHIR: Don't think I didn't try. After the first game, I told him I
had an appointment. He ignored me. After the second game, I told him I
was getting tired. He didn't believe me. And then his racquet broke and
I thought, finally. But no. He made me stay there while he went away
and replicated another one. <br>
DAX: So what finally happened? <br>
BASHIR: While he was gone, I called my assistant and told her. May I?
(gets condiment from another table) Told her to call me back after five
minutes and say there was an emergency at the Infirmary. <br>
DAX: That's terrible. <br>
BASHIR: There was no other way out. Otherwise there would have been an
emergency. Chief O'Brien's coronary. <br>
DAX: At least it's all over. <br>
BASHIR: That's just it. This is just the beginning. The Chief wants a
rematch, and I'm telling you, it's going to kill him. <br>
DAX: Honestly, Julian, you're exaggerating. O'Brien's can't be a day
over thirty eight. <br>
BASHIR: He's too young to die. I guess I'm overstating the health risk.
That's not the point. The Chief has a lot of pride, and for good
reason. I really respect him, the things he does, the kind of man he
is. I just don't want to humiliate him. </font></p>

QUARK: Lucky. <br>
MARTUS: My luck's running good today. <br>
QUARK: So I heard. Decided not to testify, did they? <br>
MARTUS: I don't know what you mean. <br>
QUARK: No? The forty seventh Rule of Acquisition says 'Don't trust a
man wearing a better suit than your own.' Either you're a con artist or
you're covering up an empty coin purse. I happen to know it's both. <br>
MARTUS: Well, we can't all be as successful as you are. <br>
QUARK: Too true. <br>
(Martus wins a game) <br>
QUARK: Some kind of game? I've never seen that one before. How do you
play? <br>
MARTUS: Just push the key. <br>
(Quark loses) <br>
MARTUS: Too bad. <br>
(Martus wins) <br>
MARTUS: As I told you, my luck's running good today. <br>
QUARK: Am I supposed to be impressed? <br>
MARTUS: A little tinkering, some replication and expansion, it might
make a nice addition to your casino. <br>
QUARK: And who would play this? It's just a child's toy. My nephew, it
might keep him out of my ears for a couple of days. I'll take it. <br>
(Quark puts coins on the bar) <br>
MARTUS: That's a tidy sum. <br>
QUARK: I'm feeling benevolent today. Have another. <br>
(Quark gives him another drink) <br>
MARTUS: I might have accepted, but the offer of the drink? That tells
me you're very interested. <br>
QUARK: Nonsense. You read too much into nothing. My benevolence is
known far and wide. <br>
MARTUS: Oh, it's legendary, I'm sure. I'll take one hundred times what
you've got here. <br>
QUARK: Not in this space-time continuum, you won't. Go try to peddle
this little triviality down on Bajor. You might be able to trade it for
a meal, but it won't be a hot one. <br>
MARTUS: You'll be in profit by the end of the week. <br>
(More coins go down) <br>
QUARK: Final offer. Take it before my generosity fades. <br>
(Martus wins) <br>
MARTUS: Perhaps I'll hold on to it a bit longer. <br>
QUARK: Suit yourself. But be under no illusion. If I was serious about
acquiring this, it would be mine, and for substantially less than what
you'd hoped for. <br>
MARTUS: It seems overconfidence comes in small packages around here. <br>
QUARK: My track record speaks for itself, just like your security file.
<br>
MARTUS: Thanks for the drink.

QUARK: Doctor, I brought you something. A token of thanks from the
monks to show how much they appreciate your participation in their
little fund-raiser. <br>
BASHIR: Thanks. Put it over there. <br>
QUARK: Aren't you going to try some? <br>
BASHIR: What is it? <br>
QUARK: The monks tell me it's a medicinal brew. An ancient secret of
their order. It's supposed to impart great energy and vigour. Just the
kind of thing to have before an athletic competition. But you're a man
of science. You probably don't believe in folk medicine. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, you'd be surprised just how often traditional
medicine turns out to have genuine value. Did they say was in this
stuff? <br>
QUARK: They didn't exactly, but I'm sure it's all completely natural.
Oh, the monks said you should drink the whole thing in one gulp in
order to get the proper effect. <br>
BASHIR: Did they? <br>
(Bashir goes to analyse the drink) <br>
QUARK: What are you doing? <br>
BASHIR: Just curious about its contents. <br>
QUARK: But what about your exercises? <br>
BASHIR: This won't take a second. <br>
QUARK: Why bother? Don't you trust the monks? <br>
BASHIR: Water, sucrose, dextrose, tribnel root extract, grain
particulates, yeast,
synthehol, and seventeen milligrams of hyvroxilated quint-ethyl
metacetamine. <br>
QUARK: Like I said, all natural. <br>
BASHIR: It's an anaesthetic, Quark. If I drank that, I'd hardly be able
to stand, let alone play racquetball. You were trying to fix the match,
weren't you. <br>
QUARK: Would I do that? <br>
BASHIR: If you had enough latinum bet on Chief O'Brien you would. <br>
QUARK: No one's betting on Chief O'Brien. All the money's on you. If
you win, there won't be any profits. And if there aren't any profits, I
can't donate anything to the monks. No donations, no winter blankets
for the children. But if you lose, then the house would win, and the
monks would get their blankets. <br>

QUARK: For the children. <br>

KIRA: There're a lot of them? <br>
DAX: The spin. Given the laws of probability, from any point of view,
about half of them should be spinning clockwise and the other half
counterclockwise. But over eighty percent of them are spinning
clockwise. <br>
KIRA: You're saying people are having accidents because of the way the
neutrinos are spinning? <br>
DAX: No, but I think it's a symptom of the same problem. The neutrinos
outside the station are normal, but inside the station something very
strange is going on.
