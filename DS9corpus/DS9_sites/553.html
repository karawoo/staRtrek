foot on this station but it's as familiar to me as the back of my hand.
Isn't that odd? <br>

Kira enters.) <br>
EZRI: I was killed here. I mean, Jadzia was. <br>
KIRA: I try not to think about that. If I did, I'm not sure that I
could come back here. <br>
EZRI: It's a strange sensation, dying. No matter how many times it
happens to you, you never get used to it. It must be a little
disconcerting for you, knowing that I have Jadzia's memories. No wonder
you're uncomfortable. <br>
KIRA: It's a lot to get used to. <br>
EZRI: Tell me about it. Well, I'll let you get to your prayers. </font></p>

to her.) <br>
EZRI: Bloodwine. <br>
QUARK: That's the good stuff. Same vintage I served when you and Worf
got married. <br>
EZRI: It smells awful. <br>
QUARK: It used to be your favourite. <br>
EZRI: I used to be right handed, too. A lot of things have changed
since I was joined. <br>
QUARK: I can imagine. Seven lifetimes worth of memories would mix up
anyone. Or is it eight? <br>
EZRI: Who knows anymore? <br>
QUARK: It'll be a lot easier once you get settled in. Have you picked
out your quarters yet? <br>
EZRI: I'm not staying. I'm going back to the Destiny to be an assistant
counsellor. <br>
QUARK: You're a therapist? <br>
EZRI: Why does everyone sound so surprised when they hear that? <br>
QUARK: Oh, it's just you're so young. Why are you in such a hurry to
leave? Why not stay for a while and get to know your old friends again.
<br>
EZRI: I don't want to force things. People need time to get over losing
Jadzia. You know something, Quark? Besides Benjamin, you're the only
one of Jadzia's friends who doesn't seem uncomfortable around me. <br>
QUARK: She and I were close, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be
close too. Remember all those late night tongo games? <br>
EZRI: Who could forget? Wait a minute. You owe me ten slips of latinum
from our last game. <br>
QUARK: I don't think so. <br>
EZRI: I won with a Full Consortium. I remember. <br>
QUARK: Your memory's playing tricks on you. <br>
EZRI: Don't say that, Quark. I'm confused enough as it is. <br>

door to the corridor.) <br>
SISKO: Dax. <br>
EZRI: Are you alone? <br>
SISKO: Why are you sneaking in this way? <br>
EZRI: I didn't want to go through Ops in case Worf was there. We bumped
into each other last night in Quark's. <br>
SISKO: It didn't go well, I take it? You weren't expecting him to
accept you right away, were you? <br>
EZRI: Of course not. But he wouldn't even talk to me. <br>
SISKO: Perhaps he was just trying to respect your customs. He knows
that the joined Trill aren't supposed to get involved with people who
were married to their previous hosts. <br>
EZRI: But that doesn't mean we can't talk to each other. Worf knows
that. <br>
SISKO: Are you sure? <br>
EZRI: I told him all about Trill traditions. Jadzia did. We discussed
them. They discussed them. <br>
SISKO: I understand. <br>
EZRI: These pronouns are going to drive me crazy. <br>
(Worf is in Ops.) <br>
EZRI: Look at him, Benjamin. He's in pain. <br>
SISKO: How can you tell? <br>
EZRI: I was his wife. I can tell. I don't want to put him through any
more heartache than he's already going through. It's a good thing I'm
going back to the Destiny. <br>
SISKO: You're still planning on leaving. <br>
EZRI: I can't stay. I couldn't do that to him. Besides, I think it
might be easier for me on the Destiny. There are too many memories
here. <br>
SISKO: I'm going to miss you, old man. <br>
EZRI: I'm going to miss you too, Benjamin.

ODO: And who am I going to be again? <br>
BASHIR: General Santa Anna. <br>
ODO: Santa Anna. <br>
BASHIR: When can our costumes be ready? <br>
(Garak is too busy with a PADD to hear.) <br>
BASHIR: Garak? <br>
GARAK: Hmm? <br>
BASHIR: Our holosuite costumes. When can they be ready? <br>
GARAK: Oh, I'm afraid you're going to have to find them from somewhere
else. The shop's closed. <br>
O'BRIEN: Still? <br>
GARAK: Well, Starfleet Intelligence is keeping me quite busy these
days. <br>
BASHIR: What if we let you be Crockett? <br>
O'BRIEN: Hey. <br>
GARAK: Even if I was interested, I don't have the time. Do you have any
idea how long it takes to decode a Cardassian military transmission? I
mean, I invented some of the basic encryption protocols when I was with
the Obsidian Order, but it still takes me several days to decipher the
simplest sentence. <br>
BASHIR: You've got to take a break sometime. <br>
GARAK: Well I intend to. Just as soon as the Dominion is driven off
Cardassia. Must you stand so close? <br>
BASHIR: That was a bit harsh. <br>
GARAK: Well, I don't like people looming over me. I have to get back to
work. Thank you for your company, gentlemen.

SISKO: His shop? I don't understand. That's a good sized space. <br>
GARAK: I know. I've been claustrophobic for as long as I can remember,
but lately it seems to have gotten worse. Rooms that I once found
completely tolerable now suddenly feel alarmingly cramped. <br>
BASHIR: I wish I had an explanation, but I don't. He checks out fine. <br>
GARAK: Well, I don't feel fine. Would you gentlemen mind terribly if we
continued this conversation on the Promenade?

GARAK: A little. <br>
SISKO: Mister Garak, as much as I appreciate with your situation, I'm
not sure why you asked to see me. <br>
GARAK: I was hoping you'd be kind enough to express my regrets to
Starfleet Intelligence. When I get this way, my concentration isn't
what it should be. I'm afraid I won't be decoding any transmissions for
a while. <br>
SISKO: Can I tell them when to expect you back on the job? <br>
GARAK: I wish I could say. Believe me, I'm not happy about this either.
I want to see an end to this war just as much as you. And now, if
you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hem some pants. For some reason,
sewing seems to calm me down. <br>
(Garak leaves.) <br>

SISKO: We can't afford to lose Mister Garak right now. Is there
anything you can do for him? <br>

EZRI: Assistant counsellor. I'm still in training. <br>
SISKO: Oh, come on, Dax. What are you going to learn in the next few
months that you haven't already learned in the last three hundred
years? <br>
EZRI: Oh, how to keep from breaking into tears for no reason. How to
resist the urge to stand on my head. Things like that. <br>
SISKO: Why are you standing on your head, by the way? <br>
EZRI: Emony used to do it. <br>

EZRI: Actually, it's giving me a headache. <br>
(She comes down and sits on the floor.) <br>
EZRI: Why can't Julian work with Garak? <br>
SISKO: Julian's a good doctor, but he's no counsellor. Not even an
assistant counsellor. And besides, he doesn't have eight lifetimes
worth of experience under his belt. <br>
EZRI: I bet he doesn't stand on his head for no reason, either. <br>
SISKO: That's a good point. Come on, old man, you can do this. <br>

GARAK: Ah. You must be Ezri Dax. The Captain told me that you'd be
dropping by to counsel me. <br>
EZRI: Is that all right? <br>
GARAK: Oh, it all depends on what it involves. I'm a very private
person. <br>
EZRI: I understand. So is it helping? The sewing. Is it making you feel
better? <br>
GARAK: Thankfully, yes. <br>
EZRI: You're lucky, nothing helps me. <br>
GARAK: Are you claustrophobic too? <br>
EZRI: Why would you say that? <br>
GARAK: You just said <br>
EZRI: No, I get spacesick. Ever since I was joined. I'm very sensitive
to motion. I can even feel the station spinning. <br>
GARAK: Really? <br>
EZRI: It's because of what happened to Torias. He was killed in a
shuttle accident. <br>
GARAK: But why would that make you spacesick? <br>
EZRI: Because I blame myself for what happened. <br>
GARAK: You were piloting? <br>
EZRI: Yes. No. Depends on how you look at it. Torias was my fifth host.
Didn't I say that? <br>
GARAK: No. <br>
EZRI: Well, he was. And I think the reason that his death has stayed
with me for so long is because I just can't seem to forgive him for
getting himself killed. <br>
GARAK: But you said it was an accident. So if he's not to blame, then
you're not to blame, either. <br>
EZRI: I know. But somehow I can't help but punish myself for it. <br>
GARAK: By getting spacesick. <br>
EZRI: Exactly. <br>
GARAK: Don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds to me as if you're
the one that needs to see a counsellor. <br>
EZRI: You're probably right. But I didn't come here to talk about
myself, I came to talk about you. <br>
GARAK: So you did. <br>
EZRI: Do you remember anything traumatic happening to you when you were
young. Something involving getting trapped in a confined space. <br>
GARAK: If I had been that careless, my father would have left me there
to teach me a lesson. <br>
EZRI: Sounds like he was strict. <br>
GARAK: He didn't get to be the head of the Obsidian Order without a
sense of discipline. <br>
EZRI: Did he discipline you? <br>
GARAK: He punished me when I misbehaved. What father wouldn't? <br>
EZRI: Tobin. <br>
GARAK: My second host. He could not bring himself to discipline his
children, no matter what they did. But that's another story. How did
you say that your father punished you? <br>
GARAK: He'd lock me in a closet. <br>
EZRI: Why didn't you mention that when I asked if you'd ever been
trapped in a confined space. <br>
GARAK: I wasn't trapped. I knew he'd let me out as soon as I learned my
lesson. <br>
EZRI: Learned your lesson? Did you think you deserved to be locked in
that closet? <br>
GARAK: I could be very stubborn. <br>
EZRI: You blame yourself. Just like I blame myself for that shuttle
accident. Maybe you get claustrophobic for the same reason that I get
spacesick. We're both punishing ourselves for things that weren't our
fault. That's it. Don't you see? We both have to let go of all this
misplaced guilt. <br>
GARAK: And if we do, our problems will simply disappear? <br>
EZRI: Not overnight, but it's a step in the right direction. <br>
GARAK: Well, I'll certainly give your advice some thought. <br>
EZRI: Me too. Are you all right? <br>
GARAK: To tell the truth, I'm starting to feel a little claustrophobic.
<br>
EZRI: Probably because we've been talking about it. Actually, I'm
starting to feel a little spacesick myself. <br>
GARAK: If it's all the same to you, I think I'll go back to my sewing. <br>

EZRI: Never mind. To what do I owe the pleasure? <br>
SISKO: I'm not going to say I told you so, but Garak stopped by Odo's

decoding. <br>

you and Worf. Now, I sympathise with what he's going through, but as
far as I'm concerned, you have as much right to be here as he does. <br>
EZRI: What are you getting at, Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: The war certainly has not been good for morale around here. I've
been thinking the station could use a good counsellor. I can't think of
anyone better suited for the job. <br>
EZRI: Thanks for saying that. But even if Worf wasn't an issue, I'm
still just an assistant counsellor. <br>
SISKO: I took the liberty of talking to Starfleet Medical. They're
willing to waive the rest of your training and give you a commission as
a full counsellor with the rank of lieutenant. <br>
EZRI: How'd you talk them into that? <br>
SISKO: I asked them what they thought you might learn in the next few
months <br>
EZRI: That I haven't already learned in the last three hundred years. <br>
SISKO: They saw my point. I hope you do, too. <br>
EZRI: It means a lot to me that you want me to stay, but I can't. <br>

ripping a dress apart.) <br>
EZRI: Garak? I thought you were going to stay in the holosuite for a
while. <br>
GARAK: I got tired of staring at a fake landscape, pretending I was
outside. No,
no, no, work is the answer. My father always used to say that people
should throw themselves into their work. Do your chores, Elim. I told
you to do your chores. <br>
EZRI: And if you didn't? What would he do to you? <br>
GARAK: Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't start. Spare me your insipid
psychobabble. I'm not some quivering neurotic who feels sorry for
himself because his daddy wasn't nice. You couldn't begin to understand
me. <br>
EZRI: I'd like to try. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I'm sure you would. You'd like nothing more than to pry into
my personal affairs. Well, I'm not interested in dissecting my
childhood. I only want to save my people from the Dominion. I don't
need someone to walk in here and hold my hand. I want someone to help
me get back to work. And you, my dear, aren't up to this task. I mean,
look at you. You're pathetic. A confused child trying to live up to a
legacy left by her predecessors. You're not worthy of the name Dax. I
knew Jadzia. She was vital, alive. She owned herself. And you? You
don't even know who you are. How dare you presume to help me? You can't
even help yourself. Now get out of here before I say something unkind.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: What's this all about? <br>
EZRI: What does it look like? I'm resigning from Starfleet. <br>
SISKO: Why? <br>
EZRI: Because I can't do my job. Garak was right. How can I help other
people when I can't even help myself? <br>
SISKO: I know this has been a hard time for you, old man, but you see <br>
EZRI: Don't call me that! I'm not the old man. I'm not Curzon. Or
Jadzia. <br>
SISKO: No, you're Ezri. Ezri Dax. And you've been given eight lifetimes
worth of experience. Now I know this is confusing for you right now,
but in time you'll see it's a wonderful gift. <br>
EZRI: It's a gift I don't deserve. <br>
SISKO: If that's the way you feel, then go back to Trill. Talk to the
Symbiosis Commission. Maybe you can convince them to take the symbiont
out of you. <br>
EZRI: I wish they could. But removing the symbiont would kill me, you
know that. <br>
SISKO: Well, if you're leaving Starfleet, you'll have to find something
to do. Let's see. Maybe you could be one of the people who takes care
of the symbiont pools? It's quiet in those caves. No one around. No one
expecting great things from you. You could spend the rest of your life
underground, in the dark, stirring mud. Eighty or ninety years of that
might be just what you need. And as for Dax? That symbiont had eight
amazing lives. So what if the ninth was a waste. <br>
EZRI: Stop it, Benjamin. I thought you of all people would understand. <br>
SISKO: I do understand. And you were right. You don't deserve the Dax
symbiont. Quite frankly, you don't deserve to wear that uniform. I'll
pass this on to Starfleet Command. Dismissed. <br>

WORF: Enter. <br>
(It's O'Brien, bearing bloodwine.) <br>
WORF: Oh, no. Not again. <br>
O'BRIEN: Compliments of Doctor Bashir. <br>
WORF: He sent you? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, that was my idea. Now, if you want to skip the drinking
and get right down to the talking, I'm game. <br>
WORF: What do you wish to discuss? <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian swears there's nothing going on between him and Ezri.
There's no reason for you to be jealous. <br>
WORF: This has nothing to do with jealousy! I know that Doctor Bashir
cared for Jadzia, but this woman is not Jadzia, and treating her as if
she were dishonours her memory. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wrong. Treating Ezri like a stranger dishonours Jadzia's
memory. <br>
WORF: It doesn't make sense. She is not Jadzia, yet she is. How can I
honour the memory of the woman I loved when she is not really dead? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't have an answer for you, Worf. Let me ask you this. How
do you think Jadzia would wanted you to treat Ezri? <br>
WORF: There's no way to know. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, there is. And the person who can tell you is the person
you've been avoiding ever since she got here.

GARAK: Well, I didn't think you'd darken my doorstep again. <br>
EZRI: I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I wish I'd been able to help you.
<br>
GARAK: So do I. <br>
EZRI: Well, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore.
I'll be leaving in the morning. <br>
GARAK: Yes, I'd heard that the Destiny was going to arrive tomorrow. <br>
EZRI: They're putting in for supplies before they head to the front.
But I won't be going with them. I've decided to go back to Trill. <br>
GARAK: How nice for you. <br>
EZRI: Actually, the Destiny's going to be joining the Seventh Fleet at
Kalandra. <br>
GARAK: Kalandra? <br>
EZRI: Those transmissions you decoded last week must have convinced
Starfleet that it's a good place to launch a new offensive. <br>
GARAK: Yes, the transmissions did indicate that it was somewhat
vulnerable. <br>
EZRI: If the offensive goes well, Starfleet will have you to thank for
it. <br>
GARAK: That's most gratifying. <br>
EZRI: I just thought you should know. <br>
(Garak can't even put a dress up on a clothes hangar.) <br>
EZRI: Are you all right? <br>
GARAK: Yes, of course I'm all right. That's very good news about
Kalandra. <br>
EZRI: Let's just hope it goes well. The Cardassians will put up a
strong fight. <br>
GARAK: Oh, indeed they will. But in the end, they'll lose. <br>
EZRI: How can you be so sure? <br>
GARAK: Because they won't be expecting an attack. Because they have no
idea that I broke their code. All those Cardassians are going to die
because of me. <br>
EZRI: I suppose that's one way of looking at it. <br>
GARAK: What other way is there? <br>
EZRI: That by helping to end the war, you'll be saving lives. <br>
GARAK: Saving lives? And what lives would I be saving? Human? Klingon?
Romulan? <br>
EZRI: And Cardassian. <br>
GARAK: No, not Cardassians. They're going to fight to the bitter end.
The Dominion will see to that. Don't you understand? Don't you see? I
wanted to believe that I was helping my people, liberating them, but
all I've done is to pave the way for their annihilation. I'm a traitor!
I've betrayed every <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EZRI: How are you feeling? <br>
GARAK: Well I'm breathing much better now. <br>
EZRI: At least we found out what's been triggering these claustrophobic
attacks you've been having. <br>
GARAK: You know, when I first agreed to help Starfleet, I was convinced
it was the right thing to do. I didn't allow myself to doubt it, even
for an instant. I never realised how much it was gnawing at me. I
suppose I was looking for a way out and the claustrophobia gave me an
excuse to stop fighting my people. <br>
EZRI: Now that you know that, what are you going to do? <br>
GARAK: Get back to work. What else can I do? The Dominion must be
stopped. Even if it does mean the destruction of Cardassia. <br>
EZRI: The Captain will be glad to hear that you're back on the job. <br>
GARAK: Well, he has you to thank for it. And so do I. And what about
you? Are you still planning to go back to Trill? <br>
EZRI: No. I'm going to stay in Starfleet. <br>

SISKO: Because I never submitted your resignation. <br>
EZRI: I had a feeling you didn't mean all those things you said to me.
You were just trying to rattle my cage. <br>
SISKO: You've done it to me often enough. I'm glad it worked. Mister
Garak has asked that the latest Cardassian transmissions be sent to the
Infirmary. Well done. <br>
EZRI: Thanks. Somehow I thought you'd be happier that I was staying in
Starfleet. <br>
SISKO: I'd be happier if you would stay here at DS Nine. <br>

counsellor. I would not want you to decline on my account. <br>
