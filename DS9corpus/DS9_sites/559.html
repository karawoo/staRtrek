EZRI: A Til'amin froth for me. <br>
BASHIR: Romulan ale, Quark. <br>
ODO: A glass of springwine. <br>
QUARK: Since when do you drink springwine, or anything else, for that
matter? <br>
ODO: It's for Kira. She should be getting out of services any minute
now. <br>
BASHIR: Well, here she is. <br>
ODO: How was it? <br>
KIRA: Beautiful. Ranjen Telna gave a very moving sermon. <br>
EZRI: What was it about? <br>
KIRA: About how important it is to forgive the people who've wronged
you. <br>
ODO: Two hours on forgiveness? <br>
BASHIR: It's a complicated subject, Odo. <br>
KIRA: What's wrong? <br>
ODO: Nothing. It's just that you spend so much time in services that
sometimes it makes me wish I were a believer so that we could go
together. <br>
EZRI: That's so sweet. <br>
KIRA: I would love for you to come with me, but I don't think you'll
get much out of it if you don't believe in the Prophets. <br>
ODO: Perhaps if I had an Orb experience? <br>
KIRA: It doesn't work like that. Faith has to come first. <br>
ODO: That's too bad. I have a feeling it must be very comforting to
believe in something more powerful than yourself. <br>
BASHIR: If you really feel that way, there are other faiths. <br>
EZRI: Would it bother you if Odo believed in Klingon religion? <br>
KIRA: Not if he got something out of it. <br>
BASHIR: He'd get to eat the hearts of his enemies. <br>
EZRI: And go to Sto'Vo'Kor when he dies. <br>
BASHIR: You can go on a vision quest. <br>
ODO: But then I wouldn't get to go to services with Kira, would I.
That's the whole point. <br>
EZRI: That really is so sweet. </font></p>

KIRA: Yes. Vedek Fala. <br>
FALA: Nerys. <br>
KIRA: What a surprise. What are you doing here? <br>
FALA: Well, I came to see you. <br>
KIRA: Well come in, sit down. Let me get you some tea. When I contacted
the University they told you were on a spiritual retreat. <br>
FALA: Ah, you know me, always searching for answers. <br>
KIRA: That's what makes you different from all the other vedeks I
known. To you, faith is a journey. <br>
FALA: Thank you. And one that never ends. Oh, you're a Colonel now. It
seems like only yesterday you were just a little girl, squirming in
your chair during instruction. <br>
KIRA: Chair? We didn't have any chairs at the camp. We sat on the
floor. <br>
FALA: Which was good for discipline and made me seem more imposing. <br>
KIRA: Oh, as if you needed the help. Nerys, what are the three keys to
enlightenment? <br>
FALA: And the answer? <br>
KIRA: Charity, humility and faith. <br>
FALA: You remember. <br>
KIRA: You were a good teacher. Without you, I'm not sure I would have
survived that camp. <br>
FALA: I brought you something. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The area that is Quark's on DS9. Kira beams in to
be greeted by Bajorans wearing red arm bands.) <br>
BRIN: Welcome to Empok Nor. <br>
KIRA: Empok Nor? That's impossible. <br>
BRIN: I know it's a long way from Deep Space Nine, but this transponder
allowed us to beam you here. <br>
KIRA: Those red armbands. You're members of the Pah wraith cult? <br>
BRIN: We worship the True Prophets, yes. <br>
KIRA: Why did you bring me here? <br>
BRIN: That is a question best answered by the Master. <br>
KIRA: And who exactly is the Master? <br>
DUKAT: I am. <br>
KIRA: Dukat. You? You're the leader of the Pah wraith cult? <br>
DUKAT: I'm sure you have many questions, Nerys, and I intend to answer
them all. Leave us, please. First of all, let me apologise for bringing
you here without your permission. <br>
KIRA: Oh, it's all right, I always wanted to see Empok Nor. Is the
Dominion aware that you've set up a temple here? <br>
DUKAT: Oh, this station has been abandoned a long time. There's no
reason why they'd object to us putting it to use. Your hair. You
changed it. <br>
KIRA: Your ear. You pierced it. <br>
DUKAT: A symbol of the Covenant I've made with my new family. <br>
KIRA: Your new family. Well, it makes sense that these people would
choose you as their leader. They worship evil. <br>
DUKAT: The Pah wraiths are not what you think, Nerys, and neither am I.
Let me ask you something. Have you ever wondered why the Prophets stood
by and did nothing when Cardassia took over Bajor? Have you ever asked
yourself how they could allow your people to suffer as they did? <br>
KIRA: The Prophets have a plan for us. It's not always easy to see what
it is. <br>
DUKAT: Even as you speak those words, you must know how hollow they
sound. No, there's a much better explanation. One that makes perfect
sense. The Prophets are not the true gods of Bajor, the Pah wraiths
are. They were cast from the Celestial Temple because they wanted to
take an active role in Bajoran life. Their only crime was that they
cared about your people. But they were not allowed to help you because
they'd lost the battle for heaven and were forced to flee. <br>
KIRA: So I guess the ancient texts just had it all wrong, then. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, come now, Nerys. You know as well as I do that history is
written by the victors. But rest assured, there will be another
chapter. The Pah wraiths are determined to reclaim their place in
heaven. <br>
KIRA: And how would you know that? <br>
DUKAT: They speak to me in visions. I am their Emissary. <br>
KIRA: I don't know whether you believe what you're saying, or if you're
faking it, or if you're just insane. <br>
DUKAT: I have touched by the hand of a god. I'm a changed man. Oh, I
admit that when I first allowed myself to become a vessel for the Pah
wraith, it was purely out of self-serving reasons. All I wanted was to
help it enter the wormhole so it could force the Prophets out. It was
nothing more than a way to exact vengeance on Sisko. But I had no idea
the effect it would have on me. It was only inside of me for a very
short time, but it opened my heart. <br>
KIRA: Would that be before or after you killed Jadzia? <br>
DUKAT: That was most unfortunate, but it couldn't be helped. The
Celestial Temple itself was at stake and she was in the way. Ah, Nerys,
Nerys. I wish I had the words to describe what it was like to have the
Pah wraith within me. I could feel its love, for me and for the Bajoran
people. It made me realise I still have a role to play in Bajor's
destiny. <br>
KIRA: You mean besides overseeing an occupation that killed tens of
millions? <br>
DUKAT: You have no idea how much it pains me to know that I caused so
much suffering. But I am not responsible for the occupation, the
Prophets are. <br>
KIRA: You have no right to say that. <br>
DUKAT: They abandoned Bajor. I was simply walking the path they laid
out for me. Now I walk with the true Prophets. I'm building a community
here, Nerys. I brought these people to Empok Nor so that we could
purify ourselves in preparation for the day the Pah wraiths reclaim the
Celestial Temple. <br>
KIRA: And what's supposed to happen when that day comes? <br>
DUKAT: The Pah wraiths have a plan. When the time is right, they will
reveal it to me. <br>
KIRA: Something tells me their plan involves you being ruler of Bajor
again. <br>
DUKAT: You're still so full of anger toward me. I can only hope that
one day you'll let it go. I brought you here because I want you to be a
part of our community. I want you to share in the love these people
have for one other. In the love they have for me. <br>
KIRA: Oh, they don't love you. You have some kind of a hold over them,
but they don't love you. <br>
DUKAT: Nerys, open your heart to me. We're bound together by destiny.
You belong at my side.

SISKO: Chief. When did you realise she was missing? <br>
ODO: This morning. She usually comes by my office before going to Ops. <br>
SISKO: Did you check the entry log? <br>
ODO: She had a visitor sometime after nineteen hundred hours. Whoever
it was only stayed about ten minutes. <br>
(Worf enters.) <br>
SISKO: Anything, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: According to the Ops report, only one ship has left the station
since last night. The morning transport to Bajor. Kira was not aboard. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, I'm picking up traces of tachyon energy. <br>
ODO: A transporter beam? <br>
O'BRIEN: With a Dominion signature. <br>
ODO: Any chance of tracing it? <br>
O'BRIEN: Afraid not. The signal's already dissipated. <br>
SISKO: Their transporters operate over longer distances than ours.
What's their maximum range? <br>
WORF: If the homing transponder was in place, up to three light years. <br>
O'BRIEN: There was a homing transponder, all right. It was wrapped in
this. <br>
ODO: Three light years. For all we know, she could be deep inside
Dominion space by now. </font></p>

KIRA: I had a feeling you'd turn up sooner or later. <br>
FALA: I know you're angry with me. <br>
KIRA: Angry? I feel sorry for you. Letting yourself be duped by Dukat
into joining this cult. <br>
FALA: I was a member of this cult, as you call it, long before Dukat. I
came to it toward the end of the occupation. It's helped me make sense
of the suffering we all had to endure. <br>
KIRA: In the camp, you kept us together. It was your faith in the
Prophets that got us through. How could you of all people would turn
your back on them? <br>
FALA: They turned their backs on us long ago. <br>
KIRA: The path the Prophets laid out for us isn't always easy, but
that's no reason to turn to hate and fear. <br>
FALA: Hate and fear. You know how often I've heard those words used to
describe us? Nothing could be further from the truth. <br>
KIRA: The Pah wraith cult tried to kill the Emissary. <br>
FALA: Dukat had nothing to do with that. The boy who attacked Captain
Sisko was acting out of his own misguided beliefs. We're a peaceful
people. <br>
KIRA: Then prove it. Let me go. <br>
FALA: Nerys, the Master brought you here because he cares about your
spiritual well being. <br>
KIRA: The Master. He's using you. He's taking your beliefs and twisting
them to suit his own purpose. <br>
FALA: You're so stubborn. That's always been your problem. <br>
KIRA: Your problem is you're too trusting. <br>
FALA: When Dukat first came to us, I didn't want to accept him. But I
came to realise the Pah wraiths had taken this man of evil and washed
him clean. What could be more wondrous than that? <br>
KIRA: How can you forget all the friends we lost during the occupation?
How can you forget all the millions Dukat murdered? <br>
FALA: You disappoint me, Nerys. Of all the things I tried to teach you,
the most important is the need to forgive. <br>
KIRA: Some things can't be forgiven. <br>
FALA: Let me show you how we live. I want you to see the community
we're building here so you'll know you have nothing to fear from Dukat,
or from us.

are granted only when he sees that a husband and wife have demonstrated
a true spiritual bond. <br>
KIRA: Oh, I see. <br>
FALA: But you don't approve. In ancient times, Bajorans understood the
value of denying worldly pleasures. Ironic, isn't it, that a Cardassian
would be the one to lead us back to the old ways? <br>
KIRA: Especially a Cardassian whose appetite for worldly pleasures is
legendary. <br>

wraith. <br>

Pah wraiths. But if you don't, it's your loss. No offence. <br>

convince others of their beliefs it's because they're really just
trying to convince themselves. <br>
BENYAN: I know what I believe. <br>

that after what just happened in the temple, you'd realise that. <br>

need to win the love of the Bajoran people. You just never understood
why we didn't appreciate you. <br>
DUKAT: If it hadn't been for me, the occupation would've been much
worse. <br>
KIRA: And you want a thank you? You were working people to death in the
ore processing centre, but that didn't stop you from strutting around
Terok Nor, picking out Bajoran women to take to your bed and actually
believing that they wanted to be there. <br>
DUKAT: Your mother did want to be there. <br>
KIRA: You took her away from her children. She did what she had to so
that we could survive. <br>

KIRA: Maybe she convinced herself that she did, which is a very
different thing. <br>
DUKAT: Perhaps you're right. And if I did indeed cause your mother any
pain, I deeply regret it. Just as I regret many things I did in those
years. That's why I'm so glad the Pah wraiths have given me an
opportunity to redeem myself in the eyes of your people. <br>
KIRA: How? By recreating some kind of idealised version of the
occupation? Because that's what you've done here. You have your station
back, Bajorans to serve your every whim. And the best part is, this
time they really do love you. As misguided as that is, they love you. <br>

most about the Bajoran people. Your passion, your spirit. I can see now
why the Pah wraiths want you at my side. <br>
KIRA: And why's that? <br>
DUKAT: Because if I can open your heart to them, then surely I can open
the heart of any Bajoran. Your anger is a challenge. I welcome it.

Nerys, is it beyond the realm of possibility that the Pah wraiths have

and you were so beautiful. <br>
MIKA: I've forgiven you. You know that. <br>
DUKAT: Have you told anyone? <br>
MIKA: No. <br>

air rushes out, then reaches to Dukat before passing out.) <br>

MIDWIFE: The depressurisation caused swelling in her meningeal tissues.
I'm going to keep her sedated until morning. <br>
DUKAT: But she will recover? <br>
MIDWIFE: She'll be fine. <br>
DUKAT: Brin. Seal the docking ring. Check all the airlocks. Let's make
sure we never have another accident like this again. <br>
KIRA: An accident? What happened, Dukat? Was Mika going to tell
everyone that you're the father of her child? <br>
FALA: Kira. <br>
KIRA: Is that why you tried to kill her? <br>
FALA: Enough. <br>
DUKAT: Fala, it's all right. Nerys is obviously upset. She doesn't know
what she's saying. <br>
KIRA: Mika isn't going to lie for you anymore. <br>
DUKAT: Take her to her quarters. She needs to rest. <br>

and I pray she does, your children will learn the truth. They will turn
away from me. They will turn away from you. The covenant will be
broken. Don't let that happen. Tell me what to do. Please. Please.

DUKAT: Promazine. Developed by the Obsidian Order for its operatives to
use in case of capture. Not only is death swift, but it reduces the
body to dust within hours, making it unidentifiable to the enemy. Dust.
That's all that will remain of my passage through this misbegotten
universe, Nerys. But it doesn't bother me because I know I'm going to
be with the Pah wraiths. <br>

ODO: I suppose you'll never know. But one thing is certain. These
people have been betrayed and now they have to find a way to pick up
the pieces and move on. <br>
KIRA: I thought Dukat was just claiming to share their faith because he
wanted them to love him. But it was more than that. He's changed. <br>
ODO: If you hadn't stopped him, he would've killed them all, and no one
would have known his body wasn't among the remains. That sounds like
the same old Dukat to me. <br>
KIRA: I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think Dukat convinced
himself that he was doing what the Pah wraiths wanted. <br>
ODO: Who knows? Maybe he was. <br>
KIRA: Either way, he believes. And that makes him more dangerous than
ever. </font> </p>
