never would have gone. <br>
DAX: It was your idea to attend the conference in the first place,
Garak. <br>
GARAK: I thought the Bajorans would be grateful to hear someone provide
them with an opposing philosophical view. <br>
DAX: Opposing view? Garak, you were trying to defend the military
occupation of their world. How grateful did you think they would be? <br>
GARAK: My understanding of this conference was that it was supposed to
be an examination of the occupation from a dispassionate historical
perspective. Instead, everyone went out of their way to dismiss
virtually everything I had to say. <br>
SISKO: I thought the Bajorans bent over backwards to be polite to you,
Garak. <br>
GARAK: Giving me a name tag that read, 'Elim Garak, former Cardassian
oppressor' was hardly polite. <br>
DAX: And what did you want it to say? Former spy? <br>
GARAK: What I would have liked was less posturing and more debate. It's
clear to me now that the Bajorans aren't really interested in
discovering historical truth as much as they are in promoting the myths
and legends of the glorious Resistance. <br>
DAX: Well, Odo wasn't a member of the Resistance and he managed to
attract a fair amount of attention. <br>
GARAK: Yes, it seems you have quite a fan club on Bajor. I half
expected you to be signing autographs at the end. <br>
DAX: Don't let him get to you, Odo. You should be proud of what you did
during the Occupation. <br>
ODO: I've nothing to be proud of. I tried to bring order to a chaotic
situation, that's all. <br>
SISKO: You need to give yourself more credit, Constable. Keeping order
during the Occupation would be a tough job for anyone, but you not only
did it, you did it by earning the trust of both sides. <br>
DAX: What was it the Moderator said? That you may have worked for the
Cardassians, but your only master was justice. <br>
SISKO: And a legend is born. </font></p>

the station. <br>
WORF: Very well. Clear them for docking on landing pad one. <br>
OKALA: Aye, sir. Commander, something's wrong. They're not responding,
and sensors show unusual EM signatures along their hull. The runabout's
on auto-pilot <br>

OKALA: Four, very weak. <br>

BELAR: Show some dignity. Look at you. No wonder the Cardassians think
we're animals. Get up! Get up! If you're going to spend the night
taking chemicals, stay off the Promenade. We don't need another

which suggests that their conscious minds are active, and yet there's
no response to any external stimuli. What's the word on the runabout? <br>
WORF: We have found preliminary indications that the ship encountered a
class two plasma storm which irradiated the vessel. <br>
BASHIR: Computer, are current neural readings for subjects Odo, Sisko,
Dax and Garak consistent with the effects of encountering a class two
plasma storm? <br>
COMPUTER: There are no recorded causal relationships between plasma
storms and specified neural readings. <br>
BASHIR: None? Computer, how many medical records are there on space
plasma phenomena? <br>
COMPUTER: Five thousand twenty one. <br>
BASHIR: Well, it would appear that a common phenomena has had an
uncommon effect on our people. <br>

occupation. <br>
DAX: Time travel? <br>
GARAK: No, it's more than that. Our clothes have changed. <br>
ODO: Could we be in a holosuite? <br>
SISKO: Computer, end programme. Let's assume that's a no for the
moment. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, we're not attracting any attention. <br>
SISKO: And we should be. Humans, Trills and changelings didn't just
stroll through Terok Nor unnoticed. <br>
GARAK: Then I should be getting some attention as well. We are in the
Bajoran sector, and Cardassians weren't exactly welcome here. <br>
SISKO: I don't think they see you as a Cardassian. I'm beginning to
think they don't see any of us as who we really are. <br>
GARAK: The clothes we're wearing are Bajoran. They're treating us like
Bajorans. <br>
SISKO: Maybe they see us as Bajorans. Any theories, old man? <br>
DAX: Some kind of cross-dimensional transfer? Our conscious minds
might've been moved through time and space into the bodies of four
Bajorans on Terok Nor. <br>
GARAK: But then why are we still seeing each other as we really are
instead of as Bajorans? <br>
DAX: I just ran out of speculation. <br>
SISKO: The last thing I remember was sitting in the runabout. <br>
DAX: There was a plasma anomaly on the sensors, and then there was this
sound. <br>
GARAK: No, not a sound. More like a strong vibration <br>
SISKO: I remember. Odo? <br>
ODO: I don't recall. But whatever's happened, we have to leave this
place. Get off the station. <br>
GARAK: Then I suggest we go directly to the authorities and explain our
situation. <br>
ODO: Garak. <br>
GARAK: I have knowledge of certain security codes that would be
sufficient to prove that I am in fact a Cardassian, even if their eyes
say otherwise. I could always say I'm an undercover operative posing as
a Bajoran and <br>
ODO: Captain, the authorities on Terok Nor will not be looking for
reasons to help us. They will be looking for a reason to interrogate
us, and believe me, you do not want to be interrogated by the
Cardassians. <br>
SISKO: I tend to agree with the Constable. If they should discover that
we're actually from the future <br>
DAX: Gul Dukat's on the second level. <br>
SISKO: Let's move on. <br>
(Odo bumps into a man with a phaser burn on his chest.) <br>
SISKO: Odo? (the man vanishes) Who was that? <br>
ODO: I don't know. <br>
GARAK: You should. It was your predecessor. <br>
ODO: My predecessor? Oh, yes. The man talking to Dukat. His name is
Thrax. He was in charge of security on the Promenade before me. <br>
DAX: That means we've gone back at least nine years. <br>
SOLDIER: You. Come with us. <br>
(They grab Dax.) <br>
SISKO: What's she done? <br>
SOLDIER: Nothing. Yet. <br>
GARAK: Perhaps there's been some misunderstanding. If I may be so bold,
you may find something which will bring you infinitely more profit than
the arrest of a Bajoran woman. <br>
SOLDIER: Latinum? <br>
GARAK: Two strips. <br>
SOLDIER: Where is it? <br>
GARAK: Ah. But our friend is still in your custody. <br>

SISKO: Don't move. <br>

(Garak's nose is bleeding.) <br>
BASHIR: Garak's septial capillaries burst at this point. The pattern of
his delta waves shows some unusual activity at the same moment. The
bleeding might be the result of some kind of psychosomatic response. <br>
WORF: You mean he thought he was injured? <br>
BASHIR: Under certain conditions, people have been known to alter their
blood pressure, lower their body temperature, even manifest a tumour as
a result of psychological stimuli. <br>
WORF: Could these stimuli cause more serious injuries? <br>
BASHIR: I don't think he could spontaneously break a bone, but he could
certainly stop his heart or break a key blood vessel in his brain. <br>
WORF: But what is causing all of this? <br>
BASHIR: At the risk of repeating myself, I just don't know.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CARDASSIAN: Step back from the gate. <br>
SISKO: He said she's been selected. What the hell does that mean? <br>
ODO: A random interrogation, forced labour relocation. It could be
anything. <br>
SISKO: That's not good enough. I want to know where they've taken her. <br>
GARAK: But before we can help Commander Dax, we need to find out who we
are in this reality. <br>
SISKO: If we could get to a computer terminal, we could ask for a
simple ID scan. <br>
ODO: Computer access was extremely limited on Terok Nor. <br>
GARAK: What about a Cardassian comp-link? I took the liberty of
borrowing this from the gentlemen who thought my nose needed
adjustment. <br>
ODO: I see I'm going to have to add the word pickpocket to your resume.
<br>
GARAK: It's only a hobby. <br>
ODO: Interesting that a simple tailor should just happen to have a
high-level security code. <br>
GARAK: Yes, isn't it? And if my nose didn't hurt so much, I'd tell you
with a fascinating story about how I came to possess it. Ah, yes.
Captain, you are actually a Bajoran electronics engineer. You're thirty
eight years old, you have no criminal record, your family resides in
Rakantha province and your name is Ishan Chaye. Lucky me. I'm an
artist. I'm fifty five, I've been arrested three times for disturbing
the peace. I must be incorrigible. I also reside in Rakantha and my
name is Jillur Gueta. <br>
SISKO: And the Constable? <br>
GARAK: Ah, yes. His profession is <br>
ODO: I'm a bookkeeper. Forty six years old. I have a wife and two sons
in Rakantha Province, and my name is Timor Landi. <br>
GARAK: That's right. <br>
SISKO: How'd you know that? Odo? <br>
QUARK: Congratulations, gentlemen. You get to work today. And you'll be
labouring in the finest establishment on the station. My establishment.
Twelve hours of work, two five minute breaks, one slip of latinum each.
Let's go. Didn't you hear me? I'm offering you work. What are you
waiting for? <br>
SISKO: Nothing. Just show us the way. <br>
QUARK: Open it. Start by stepping through the gate that the nice man
has opened for you. Very good. You three must be warp engineers. Now
we're going to walk down the Promenade to the bar. Would you like me to
hold your hands or can you manage it? <br>
SISKO: We'll manage. <br>
QUARK: I'm so glad. <br>
ODO: How much damage would it do to the timeline if Quark were to
suffer a mysterious accident? <br>
SISKO: I'm not sure. But maybe we should conduct a little experiment
and find out.

nothing to fear from me. I did not bring you here to be abused. <br>
DAX: Then why am I here? <br>
DUKAT: It may surprise you to hear this, but my position is a lonely
one. I'm isolated from the people who live under my protection. I
require someone to talk with. In short, a friend. <br>
DAX: You want me to be your friend? <br>
DUKAT: Ironic, isn't it, that I should choose a simple Bajoran girl to
share my inner thoughts with. But as you get to know me, Leeta, I think

occupation being a little more tidy than this. <br>
SISKO: Everything's tidy when someone else is doing the cleaning. <br>
GARAK: The Bajorans were much more suited for this sort of thing than
we were. Servile work is in their nature. <br>
SISKO: I'll remember to mention that to Major Kira when we get back. <br>
GARAK: There are exceptions to every rule. <br>

SISKO: You all right? <br>
ODO: The smell's making me sick. <br>
SISKO: How did you know your name would be Timor Landi in this, this,
whatever this is. <br>
ODO: I recognised the other two names from the security files kept
during the Occupation. Timor, Ishan and Jillur were the names of three
Bajorans who were accused of attempting to assassinate Gul Dukat on the
Promenade. <br>
SISKO: Half the resistance tried to kill Dukat. <br>
ODO: These three were innocent. However, no one knew that at the time
and Dukat wanted to make an example of them, so he had them led out
onto the Promenade and publicly executed. <br>

THRAX: Quark. I understand you had a visit from a Talavian freighter
captain this morning. A Captain Livara, I believe. <br>
QUARK: I had a lot of visitors this morning. It was a busy day. <br>
THRAX: I'm surprised you're being so indiscreet. Captain Livara is a
known smuggler. <br>
QUARK: You don't say? Such a nice, friendly man, too. I guess you can
never tell what some people are really like. <br>
THRAX: Rumour has it that the Obsidian order has had him under
surveillance for several months. <br>
QUARK: The Obsidian Order? <br>
THRAX: Rumour also has it that they're planning on bringing in all of
Livara's co-conspirators for questioning. <br>
QUARK: Well, you know how rumours are. <br>
THRAX: Yes. They're usually true. So when the Order asks me for a list
of all of Livara's known associates on board the station <br>
QUARK: He was here for ten minutes. He wanted to unload a shipment of
maraji crystals, but I wasn't interested. I can't move maraji crystals.
The Cardassians don't like them and the Bajorans can't afford them, so
I sent him on his way, all right? <br>
THRAX: And that's all? <br>
QUARK: That's all. <br>
THRAX: I hope so. Because if I find out that you've been dealing in
illegal crystals, I'll hand you over to the Order myself. <br>

QUARK: Always a pleasure. <br>
SISKO: I see you're not the first man around here to keep Quark on his
toes. <br>
ODO: Yes. <br>
(Garak uses the stolen ID device.) <br>
GARAK: Something's wrong. Thrax talked about a Captain Livara. <br>
SISKO: Does that name mean something to you? <br>
GARAK: Livara wasn't just another smuggler. He was a Romulan spy and he
didn't begin working in this sector until seven years ago. But seven
years ago, Thrax wasn't on Terok Nor, you were, Odo. Odd contradiction.
So I checked the date. This is seven years ago. Thrax shouldn't be
here. You should be the Security Chief. <br>
ODO: None of this makes any sense, Garak. Now I suggest we concentrate
on finding a way out of here. That's our priority. <br>
SISKO: I tend to agree. <br>
GARAK: Well, you'll get no argument from me. But how? <br>
SISKO: We need to contact the Bajoran resistance. They might be able to
get us off the station, maybe even to the Federation. Kira once told me
about a prearranged signal the resistance used on Terok Nor to set up a
meeting. Once we're finished here, we'll head back to the Bajoran
sector and I'll make the signal.

from Rakantha Province. Yesterday you paid a visit the chemist shop and
then fell asleep on the Promenade. Last night you were hired as a
cleanup crew by the Ferengi, and after you were paid, you went back to
the Bajoran sector and attempted to murder Gul Dukat with a chambered
plasma grenade. <br>
SISKO: We were sitting at a table eating when the grenade went off.
There are witnesses. <br>
THRAX: None of which have come forward. <br>
ODO: Why would the witnesses risk their lives for three strangers?
They're out there, but you have to go look for them. <br>
THRAX: Epidermal scans revealed the presence of trinitrogen chloride on
your hands and clothing. TNC is one of the components used in plasma
grenades. <br>
ODO: TNC is also a cleaning solution, which is what we were using in

ODO: Interrogate the troops yourself, don't just take their report at
face value. <br>
THRAX: I don't interrogate members of the Cardassian military. <br>

DAX: I don't get to eat like this very often. <br>
DUKAT: I've wanted to increase rations in the Bajoran sector for some
time now, but the resistance makes it almost impossible to show any
sort of kindness to your people. <br>
DAX: You really want to help my people, don't you? <br>
DUKAT: Yes, of course. The Bajorans are, well, they're like my
children, I suppose. And like any father, I want only what's best for
them. <br>
DAX: And you still feel like that now after some of your children have
tried to kill you? <br>
DUKAT: Bad manners are the fault of the parent, not the child. My
weakness is I'm too generous, too forgiving. My heart is too big. <br>
(Dax goes up behind him and knocks him out.) <br>
DAX: And so is your ego. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GARAK: Yes, I know I don't look Cardassian. You
see, I was surgically altered to appear Bajoran. But what if genetic
scans show no cardassian DNA in my cellular structure? In that case,
I'll suggest <br>
SISKO: Tell me about Thrax. <br>
ODO: What do you want to know? <br>
SISKO: Something about his background. He seems unusual. Doesn't have
that casual brutality I've come to expect from Cardassian security
officers. What makes Thrax different? <br>
ODO: I wouldn't know. He was gone by the time I came aboard the
station. <br>
SISKO: That brings up a good point. Why is he here now? Garak said that
you were the security chief during this time. <br>
ODO: You're implying that I should know the answers, that I'm holding
back information? <br>
SISKO: I'm saying that maybe you know more than you think you do. You
lived here, on Terok Nor. You're supposed to be out there now instead
of Thrax. Think, Odo. There might be some connection between you and
what's happening here. <br>
ODO: I don't know! <br>

DAX: Miss me?
ODO: It doesn't have to happen again

THRAX: Halt! <br>
(Dax whirls and shoots the guard behind them, then gets shot herself.
Odo fights that guard, Sisko fights Thrax. Garak shoots the guard who
is throttling Odo is fighting. Sisko and Thrax trade blows, then Thrax
morphs into goo and goes into a vent. They all help Dax up.) <br>
GARAK: A changeling? <br>

SOLDIER: We just got the word. Your execution's been scheduled for
nineteen hundred. That's two hours from now. <br>
ODO: We've got to find another way out of here. <br>
DAX: We tried that. Escape doesn't seem to be the answer. <br>
SISKO: How could Thrax be a changeling? In this time period, the
Founders didn't know about the wormhole. <br>
ODO: I don't know. <br>
GARAK: Putting aside the newest shape-shifter in town for the time
being, how did we end up back in this cell? <br>
ODO: I don't know. <br>
DAX: Care to guess? <br>
ODO: What makes you think I have the answers? <br>
SISKO: You've been acting strangely ever since we first woke up on the
Promenade. Continually distracted, depressed and agitated. <br>
GARAK: And you knew the names of the people we're supposed to be. <br>
SISKO: You knew the details of their case like you were there. <br>
GARAK: But you couldn't have been there because it happened before you
came aboard the station. <br>
SISKO: Everything seems to lead back to you and I want to know why. <br>
THRAX: You said you wanted to see me? <br>
ODO: Yes. It's urgent. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THRAX: I'm listening, but I don't have much time. <br>
ODO: You're about to make a very serious mistake. <br>
THRAX: Because you're innocent, of course. All of you. <br>
ODO: That's right, and I can prove it. Compare this attack to recent
bombings on Bajor. You'll find a similarity to four incidents in
Musilla Province, none of which we could have done. <br>
THRAX: That proves nothing. And under Cardassian law, the accused must
prove his innocence. Since the evidence in this case is sufficient to
warrant conviction, the investigation is over. <br>
ODO: Your job is to find the truth, not obtain convictions. <br>
THRAX: Truth? You want the truth? All right. The truth is that none of
you would be accused, none of you would even be here if the Bajorans
weren't fighting the Cardassians. It's futile. The occupation has
lasted for fifty years and it will probably last another fifty. <br>
ODO: I wouldn't be too sure about that. <br>
THRAX: Why not accept it? If the Bajoran people would accept their
place in history, none of this would be happening. <br>
ODO: We're talking about the attempt on Gul Dukat's life, not the
socio-political ramifications of the resistance. <br>
THRAX: It's all part of the same problem. When your people resort to
terrorism and violence, they're fighting against order, against
stability, against the rule of law, and this must be stopped. <br>
ODO: There is more to life than the rule of law. <br>
THRAX: It has been my observation that only the guilty make that kind
of statement. <br>
ODO: I didn't want to tell you this. I don't know what the consequences
will be, but we're not terrorists. We're not even Bajorans. There's
been a temporal displacement of some kind. We don't belong in this
time. We're from the future. <br>
THRAX: I know. <br>
ODO: You know? Then what are you going to do about it? <br>
THRAX: What I am supposed to do, nothing more, nothing less. The
question is, what are you going to do, Odo?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Blink and Odo is watching Sisko, Dax and Garak
lined up against the railing for execution.) <br>
THRAX: It's too late for them now. It's out of my hands. <br>
ODO: Why aren't I with them? <br>
THRAX: There were only three terrorists, Odo. You know that. <br>
DUKAT: This the price for taking up arms against those who would
protect you, who have only your best interests at heart. <br>
ODO: They haven't done anything. They don't belong here. <br>
THRAX: It's already happened, Odo. <br>
ODO: But this isn't what happened. It wasn't these people. <br>
THRAX: Proceed with the execution. <br>
(A soldier levels his gun at Sisko.) <br>
ODO: No! I'm not going to let this happen again! Not again! <br>
(Odo knocks the gun out of the soldier's hands.) <br>
ODO: You can't execute them. You don't even belong here. I do. <br>
(Suddenly everyone is back in their proper clothes, and there is weapon
fire nearby. The executions are taking place on another crossover
bridge, with another Odo watching. Their eyes meet then the historical
characters vanish.) <br>
SISKO: Constable? <br>
ODO: That's exactly how it happened seven years ago. <br>
SISKO: It was you all along. <br>
ODO: Yes. I was Chief of Security on the Promenade. I was the one who
charged those men with a crime they didn't commit, and I was the one
who turned them over to Dukat. Three days after the executions there
was another bombing on the Promenade, identical to the one that almost
killed Dukat. Timor, Ishan and Jillur were innocent. All the evidence
was there. The inconsistencies in the reports of the soldiers who
arrested them, a pattern of bombings, the ballistics. It was all there
from the beginning but I was too busy, too concerned
with maintaining order and the rule of law. I thought of myself as the
outsider, the shape-shifter who cared for nothing but justice. It never
occurred to me that I could fail, but I did. And I never wanted anyone
to know the truth. That seven years ago, I allowed three innocent men
to die. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Security office]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: As far as I can tell, the four of you were
locked into some version of the Great Link. <br>
ODO: The Link? How is that possible? I'm a solid now. <br>
BASHIR: Well, it seems you're not as solid as you think. When I ran a
neurochemical scan of your brain, I found residual traces of
morphogenic enzymes which I've only detected before in changelings. <br>
ODO: When the plasma storm hit the runabout it activated the enzymes
and initiated a telepathic response. <br>
BASHIR: Your mind reached out to find other changelings to form the
Link, but all it could find was Sisko, Dax and Garak. <br>
ODO: And just before the accident, I was thinking about the executions.
Somehow being in the Link must have forced me to relive it, and admit
the truth about what I'd done. <br>
BASHIR: It would make a fascinating paper. (gets a Look) Although I
don't intend to write one. <br>
(Kira enters) <br>
BASHIR: If you have any questions, you know where to find me. <br>
(Bashir leaves) <br>
KIRA: When I first read your report I didn't know what to think. So I
said to myself, that's all right, Nerys You're stunned. You need to let
it sink in a little. But it's been two days, Odo. I still don't know
what to think. <br>
ODO: I'm guilty. What more is there to say? <br>
KIRA: Maybe nothing. Maybe a lot. I believed in you. A lot of people
did. You were special. You were the one man who stood apart from
everyone else, the one man who stood for justice. Now what? <br>
ODO: Now I'm just another imperfect solid. <br>
KIRA: Okay. The Prophets know I'm not perfect. I guess the truth is
that anyone who lived through the occupation had to get a little dirty.
But I need to know that no other innocent people died on your watch,
Odo. That this was the only time. <br>
ODO: I'm not sure. I hope so. </font> </p>
