<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Night, and Morn is sleeping on a bench) <br>
ODO: All right, Morn, you know the rules. No sleeping on the Promenade.
Go home.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Morn can't get in because a private game of tongo
is in full swing) <br>
QUARK: The risk is to you, Lieutenant. <br>
DAX: I could probably think better without your hand on my thigh. <br>
QUARK: Now, how did that get there? So what's it going to be? Confront?
Evade? Acquire? Retreat? <br>
DAX: Confront. (the winner) Yes. <br>
ROM: Doesn't she ever lose? <br>
QUARK: Tell me, Lieutenant, how did you get to be so good at tongo? <br>
DAX: Actually, it was Curzon that played it all the time. <br>
ROM: Well, that explains it. It's Curzon who's beating us, not this
female. <br>
DAX: This female happens to be a better player than Curzon ever was. <br>
QUARK: And a prettier one too. <br>
ROM: Maybe so, but I still prefer a Ferengi female. One who never wears
clothes, never talks back, and never plays tongo. <br>
DAX: Is that how you really prefer your women? Naked and submissive? <br>
QUARK: Do you find such a lifestyle appealing? <br>
DAX: Don't you wish. <br>
QUARK: I do. I really do. <br>
DAX: All right. The opening risk is at five strips of latinum. The
purchase is at three, the sell at eight. <br>
(Pel whispers to Rom) <br>
ROM: No, absolutely not. This isn't the proper time. <br>
QUARK: I'm trying to concentrate. <br>
ROM: I'm sorry, brother. It's this insolent young waiter's fault. <br>
PEL: My apologies, Quark, but I really think you should try this. <br>
(a handful of what look like dried peas) <br>
QUARK: What is it? <br>
PEL: A way to double your beverage profits. Taste it. <br>
(Quark has one and immediately sips his water) <br>
PEL: You see? Just as I told you. He immediately reached for his drink.
<br>
QUARK: So I did. (has another one) Amazing. You don't even realise
you're thirsty. What are they? <br>
PEL: Gramilian Sand Peas. They inhibit secretion of the salivary glands
while drying out the tissues of the tongue. It works every time. If you
replace your complimentary dishes of lokar beans with Gramilian sand
peas, you won't be able to fill your customers' glasses fast enough. <br>
QUARK: What's your name again? <br>
PEL: Pel. So what do you think about my idea? <br>
QUARK: I think I agree with the fifty ninth Rule of Acquisition. Free
advice is seldom cheap. <br>
PEL: True, but the twenty second rule says, A wise man can hear profit
in the wind. <br>
QUARK: I see you know your Rules. <br>
PEL: All two hundred and eighty five of them, and the various
commentaries as well. I don't plan on being a waiter forever. <br>
ROM: Good, then you're fired. <br>
QUARK: Shut up, Rom. When it comes to business, my brother has the weak
little lobes of a female. So, what made you take a job here at the
station? <br>
PEL: I wanted to learn from the very best. <br>
QUARK: Which brings to mind the thirty third Rule of Acquisition <br>
QUARK + PEL: It never hurts to suck up to the boss. <br>
(Amid laughter, an alarm sounds) <br>
DAX: What's that? <br>
QUARK: The Grand Nagus Zek's personal subspace frequency. <br>
ROM: I wonder what he wants. <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: Why do you look so surprised? I told you I'd be back.
<br>
QUARK: I've looked forward to your return, Nagus. <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: Still the perfect little toady, eh, Quark? <br>
QUARK: I try to be. <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: Then listen carefully. The Ferengi expansion into the
Gamma Quadrant is about to begin. I'd like you to be my chief
negotiator. <br>
QUARK: Me? <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: That's right. I'm offering you an opportunity to make
more profit than you ever dreamed of. All you have to do is earn it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ZEK: Can I interest you in some Hupyrian beetle
snuff? <br>
SISKO: I don't think so. <br>
ZEK: Major? <br>
KIRA: No, thank you. <br>
ZEK: Well, suit yourself. More for me. <br>
(Maihar'du proffers the handkerchief after the sneeze) <br>
ZEK: A little late, aren't we? So, you wanted to see me, Commander? <br>
SISKO: I understand you're planning to host a business conference here
at the station. <br>
ZEK: Yes, with the Dosi, a race from the Gamma Quadrant. A very
profitable opportunity for all concerned, I might add. <br>
KIRA: Profitable for the Ferengi, maybe. <br>
ZEK: Are you implying something, Major? <br>
KIRA: Me? Not at all. No. The Ferengi's reputation speaks for itself. <br>
ZEK: A reputation of honesty, and decency, and reliability. You always
know what to expect when you do business with the Ferengi. <br>
KIRA: Which is why, if you're smart, you don't do business with the
Ferengi. <br>
SISKO: I think you've made your point, Major. <br>
ZEK: As misinformed and misguided as it may be. Besides, how we do
business is no concern of yours. <br>
SISKO: Except when you conduct your business on this station. <br>
KIRA: In other words, Zek, Grand Nagus or no Grand Nagus, if we allow
you to hold these negotiations here, and we find out you're cheating
the Dosi, I'll see to it that you never set foot on this station again.
<br>
ZEK: Did anyone ever tell you your eyes shine with the brilliance of
Kibberian fire diamonds. <br>
KIRA: Not that I recall. <br>
ZEK: Well they do. So, tell me, Major, could Bajor use fifty thousand
kilos of brizeen nitrate? <br>
KIRA: Of course we could. With that much brizeen, we could fertilise
the entire northern peninsula. <br>
ZEK: Well I've recently come into possession of fifty thousand kilos of
brizeen nitrate, and to show you how much your cooperation means to me,
I'll let you have the entire shipment. <br>
SISKO: I'll still need your assurances that the Dosi will be fairly
treated while they're here. <br>
ZEK: You have my word. <br>
SISKO: Good. <br>
ZEK: Then it's settled. Now, let's see, that's fifty thousand kilos at
twenty five percent off our usual price. <br>
SISKO: Twenty five percent? You just said you were giving it to them. <br>
ZEK: Well, you're right, Commander. We're all friends here. So I'll let
you have it at cost. <br>
SISKO: I have a better idea. Why not consider the nitrate as a gift to
the people of Bajor. <br>
ZEK: A gift? That doesn't sound very profitable. <br>
SISKO: It depends. <br>
ZEK: On what? <br>
SISKO: On whether you want to conduct business here or not. <br>
ZEK: Your negotiation skills aren't bad for a human. Your nitrate will
be delivered promptly. Anything else you need, please come see me
personally.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Zek is having his ears combed) <br>
ZEK: You know Quark, I've been involved in some profitable
opportunities in my time, but my lobes are telling me this may be the
most profitable opportunity in Ferengi history. <br>
QUARK: Imagine that. And part of those profits will be mine. <br>
ZEK: Profit. Fame. Power. As much as you want. <br>
QUARK: Tell me, Nagus, what exactly is this great opportunity. <br>
ZEK: I can sum it up in one word. Tulaberries. <br>
QUARK: Tulaberries? <br>
ZEK: Exactly. <br>
QUARK: Go on. <br>
ZEK: Well, they're the main ingredient in tulaberry wine. Your job is
to purchase ten thousand vats from the Dosi. <br>
QUARK: We're going into the wine business? <br>
ZEK: Within a single year we'll have made tulaberry wine the most
popular drink in their entire sector. That's enough. Oh, I like it.
Very distinguished. <br>
QUARK: Tell me, Nagus, how are tulaberries going to be the most
profitable opportunity in Ferengi history? <br>
ZEK: Do I have to spell it out for you? <br>
QUARK: If you don't mind. <br>
ZEK: Tulaberries will establish a Ferengi presence inside the Gamma
Quadrant. And once we get our foot in the door, they'll never get it
out. <br>
QUARK: Yes, I see. <br>
ZEK: Tulaberries, Quark. Tulaberries.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quark's]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROM: Tulaberries. I wonder what they taste like? <br>
QUARK: Who cares what they taste like. They're an opportunity to get a
Ferengi foot in the Gamma Quadrant door. <br>
ROM: And it'll be your foot, brother. I'm so proud. <br>
QUARK: I'm going to make history, Rom. And I'm going to be rich. And I
have the Grand Nagus to thank for it. He must really like me. <br>
PEL: Just remember one thing. The bigger the smile, the sharper the
knife. <br>
QUARK: Forty eighth Rule of Acquisition. <br>
PEL: I'd keep it in mind if I were you. <br>
ROM: He has some nerve. I warned you about that fellow. <br>
QUARK: Pel, do you mind telling me what you meant just now? <br>
PEL: Did you ever think about why the Nagus is putting you in charge of
such a lucrative opportunity? <br>
QUARK: Isn't it obvious? He knows I have the lobes for business. <br>
PEL: That's only part of it. <br>
ROM: I refuse to stand here and allow my brother to be insulted. You're
fired. <br>
QUARK: Shut up. Go on. <br>
PEL: If the negotiations are profitable, then the Nagus becomes a
greater hero than ever. But if they fail, he's going to need someone to
take the blame. <br>
QUARK: You mean me? <br>
PEL: All I'm saying is, be careful. <br>
ROM: I never heard such ridiculous lies. He's just jealous of your
success, brother. <br>
QUARK: No, he's right. If something goes wrong, it'll be my fault. <br>
ROM: Then you're going to need help, brother. <br>
QUARK: Yes. <br>
ROM: Someone to serve as your consultant during negotiations. <br>
QUARK: Yes. <br>
ROM: Someone like me. <br>
QUARK: No. I've been thinking about what you just said, and I probably
could use some help during these negotiations. <br>
PEL: I accept. <br>
QUARK: Good. <br>
PEL: Then we're partners. <br>
QUARK: Not quite. I don't need a partner, I need an assistant. <br>
PEL: All right. But I get twenty five percent of everything you make. <br>
QUARK: Fifteen. <br>
PEL: Twenty. <br>
QUARK: Done. <br>
ROM: But brother, what can I do to help? <br>
QUARK: You want to help? Table six is waiting.

negotiator. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quark's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: So, er, can I get anyone something to eat?
All right, in that case, let's go over our offer. As you know, the
Ferengi are interested in purchasing ten thousand vats of tulaberry
wine. In exchange, the Dosi will receive what I consider to be a very
fair trade package. <br>
PEL: There are some very interesting items on that list. A subspace
field modulator, some optical data processors. <br>
INGLATU: We'll give you five thousand vats. <br>
QUARK: I'm afraid that won't be enough. We're looking to establish a
vast distribution network in the Gamma Quadrant. We'll need at least
ten thousand vats. <br>
INGLATU: I'm offering you five thousand vats. I suggest you take it. <br>
PEL: The Nagus will never agree. <br>
ZYREE: (a female Dosi) This is a waste of time. We should be talking
directly to Zek. <br>
INGLATU: I know we should be talking to Zek. <br>
ZYREE: Then why do you bother talking to this insignificance? <br>
INGLATU: Now see what you've done. <br>
QUARK: What? <br>
INGLATU: You've made me look foolish. <br>
QUARK: I didn't mean to. <br>
ZYREE: Then bring us Zek. <br>
PEL: The Nagus has asked Quark to represent him during these
negotiations. <br>
ZYREE: Are you implying that Zek is too important to negotiate with us?
<br>
QUARK: We never meant to imply anything of the sort. <br>
INGLATU: Because if we kill you, (Inglatu snaps the PADD in half) Zek
will have to talk to us. <br>
PEL: You want to do business with the Ferengi, you talk to Quark. <br>
QUARK: So, how about it? Do we say ten thousand vats? <br>
INGLATU: We'll think about it.

KIRA: It's latinum. Excuse me. I really can't accept this. <br>
(Maihar'du is already leaving) <br>
KIRA: Did Zek really think this was going to get him anywhere? <br>
DAX: Probably not, but it doesn't stop a Ferengi from trying. <br>
KIRA: You sound like you admire them for it. <br>
DAX: I suppose in a way I do. <br>
KIRA: I don't understand your attitude about the Ferengi. <br>
DAX: That's because you don't socialise with them the way I do. Looking
back over seven lifetimes, I can't think of a single race I've enjoyed
more. <br>
KIRA: Did anyone ever tell you that you have very strange taste? <br>
DAX: I admit they place too much emphasis on profit, and their
behaviour toward women is somewhat primitive. <br>
KIRA: They're greedy, misogynistic, untrustworthy little trolls and I
wouldn't turn my back on one of them for a second. <br>
DAX: Neither would I. But once you accept that, you'll find they can be

ROM: Evade. <br>
PEL: Evade. <br>
QUARK: Retreat. <br>
ZEK: Acquire. <br>
DAX: Confront. <br>
ZEK: Did I say acquire? I meant evade. <br>
DAX: You said acquire. <br>
ZEK: But I meant evade. <br>
QUARK: Why don't we just play the round over. <br>
ROM: That sounds fair. <br>
ZEK: Who asked you? And shouldn't you be plotting strategy for
tomorrow's negotiations? <br>
QUARK: Believe me, Nagus, I've thought of nothing else all evening. <br>
ROM: That must be why you're losing so badly. <br>
QUARK: And I think by tomorrow we should have an agreement. <br>
ZEK: Well I've been thinking, too, and ten thousand vats of tulaberry
wine aren't enough. Tell them we want a hundred thousand. <br>
QUARK: A hundred thousand? But I'm not sure they'll even agree to sell
us ten thousand. <br>
ZEK: A hundred thousand vats would mean more profit for them and for
us. Now do as I say, or I'm going to take over the negotiations myself.
<br>
PEL: I think raising the stakes is a brilliant idea. <br>
ZEK: You do? <br>
PEL: It'll show the Gamma Quadrant we mean business. No wonder Quark
says you're a genius. <br>
ZEK: He says that, does he? <br>
QUARK: All the time. <br>
ZEK: That's very touching. Now bring me some fresh tube grubs. These
are losing their crunch. <br>
QUARK: Right away. <br>
ZEK: So, I believe the next challenge goes to you. <br>
PEL: I think I'll pass on this round. <br>

ZEK: Such loyalty must be expensive. <br>
DAX: You can't buy that kind of loyalty. <br>
ZEK: You can where I come from. <br>
(At the bar) <br>
PEL: Is the Nagus always this impatient? <br>
QUARK: He wants results, and he expects me to get them. But he's not
making my job any easier. A hundred thousand vats. That's a lot of
tulaberries. <br>
PEL: You'll get them. <br>
QUARK: How can you be so sure? <br>
PEL: Because you're good. And with me helping you, you're even better. <br>
QUARK: Why are you being so nice to me? <br>
PEL: For twenty percent of your profits, why else? <br>

PEL: It doesn't. I like to try new things. <br>
DAX: That's unusual for a Ferengi. <br>
PEL: I never heard of a Trill who could play tongo. <br>
DAX: I guess that makes us both unusual. You know, I was impressed by
your show of loyalty to Quark last night. <br>
PEL: He deserves it. <br>
DAX: That's not the point. Any other Ferengi would have let Zek pick
him to pieces, but you're not like any other Ferengi I've ever met. <br>
PEL: Quark really likes you. He talks about you all the time. <br>
DAX: You know he once convinced me to go up to a holosuite with him.
Turns out he recreated the bedroom I slept in as a child. He overheard
me describing it to Kira. Of course, most of the details were wrong,
but it was a very sweet gesture, up until he tried to kiss me. <br>
PEL: That sounds like Quark. <br>
DAX: I don't care what anybody says, I love him. <br>
PEL: So do I. <br>
DAX: You really do, don't you? <br>
PEL: What? <br>
DAX: Love Quark. Don't bother trying to deny it. I've seen the way you
look at him. <br>
PEL: Please, keep your voice down. <br>
DAX: Does he know? <br>
PEL: He doesn't even know I'm a female. <br>
DAX: You're a woman? <br>
PEL: Please lower your voice. <br>
DAX: I knew there was something different about you, but I've never met
a Ferengi woman before. <br>
PEL: You probably never will again. On my world, women aren't allowed
to leave the house, or wear clothes, or learn to read. <br>
DAX: And you wanted more. <br>
PEL: Why not? I'm as smart as any man. So I made myself a pair of
synthetic lobes and became one. <br>
DAX: But why come here? <br>
PEL: To acquire profit, of course. There's only one thing I wasn't
counting on. <br>
DAX: Falling in love with Quark. <br>
PEL: What do you think I should do? <br>
DAX: I don't know. But I do know there's more to life than profit. <br>

twenty percent share of the profits and that's all you're going to get.

PEL: I see. <br>
QUARK: Never place friendship above profit. <br>

bother to insult me anymore. It's Pel, that flabby eared interloper.
He's stealing my brother's affections. <br>
ODO: You're better off. <br>
ROM: But he's my brother. Would you let someone steal you're brother? <br>
ODO: I don't have a brother. Not that I know of, anyway. <br>

Quark, I wouldn't let anyone come between us.

QUARK: Busy? Don't be ridiculous. We can't wait to hear what you have
to say. Besides, we could use the company. Isn't that right. <br>
PEL: Absolutely. <br>
ZYREE: All right, then. Let me give you some advice. Inglatu will never
sell you a hundred thousand vats of tulaberry wine. Not because he
doesn't want to, but because he can't. <br>
QUARK: If he can't, who can? You? <br>
ZYREE: I wish I could, but there aren't that many vats on the entire
planet. <br>
QUARK: Then we're finished. <br>
ZYREE: Not necessarily. If you really want a hundred thousand vats of
tulaberry wine, I can put you in touch with the right people. For a
price, of course. <br>
QUARK: Of course. I always said you were my favorite Dosi. Now, who do
we have to see? <br>
ZYREE: The Karemma. <br>
PEL: Who's the Karemma? <br>
ZYREE: An important power in the Dominion. <br>
QUARK: The Dominion? What's that? <br>
ZYREE: Let's just say if you want to do business in the Gamma Quadrant,
you have to do business with the Dominion.

he meant the Dominion. That's why he sabotaged the negotiations. He

QUARK: Not now. I'm waiting. <br>
ZEK: Well, most of my information consists of little more than hints
and whispers, but it's enough to convince me that whoever learns the
secret of the Dominion, whatever that may be, will learn the secret of
the Gamma Quadrant. Unfortunately, the Dosi don't seem to know very
much. I was hoping they'd lead us to someone who does. <br>

ZEK: A lot. <br>
QUARK: What if I told you I can arrange a meeting between you and a
