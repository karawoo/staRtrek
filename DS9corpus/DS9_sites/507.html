SISKO: Don't you think you might be overpacking? <br>
JAKE: It'll close. <br>
SISKO: You don't have to take everything at once. It's not like you're
moving to Bajor. One G twelve is practically right next door. <br>
JAKE: I know, but I'm not moving to one G twelve. I found some great
quarters over in section M. <br>
SISKO: That's all the way on the other side of the habitat ring. <br>
JAKE: Dad, don't get all sentimental on me. <br>
SISKO: Wait until your son moves out on you. <br>
JAKE: I don't have a son. <br>
SISKO: Ha, ha. Go ahead, Jake, make jokes. One day you'll be standing
where I am, and believe me, you won't like it any more than I do. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, maybe, but right now I'm standing here and I can't wait to
spend my first night in my own place. <br>
(Slams the case shut.) <br>
JAKE: See? I told you it'd close. <br>
SISKO: Now wait, wait, let me get this straight. I can visit any time I
want, but I have to call first. You won't be available for breakfast or
lunch, but I can count on one dinner a week. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, well some weeks maybe even two. <br>
SISKO: Ah. I have raised a very generous son. You and Nog moving in
together. I can remember when I didn't even want you talking to him. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, well, things change. <br>
SISKO: They sure do.

QUARK: Who'd you think it was? <br>
ROM: Nog. <br>
QUARK: How could it be Nog? His ship hasn't even docked yet. <br>
ROM: I guess I wasn't thinking. <br>
QUARK: What else is new? <br>
ROM: Can I help it if I'm excited? My son is coming home. Root beer?
His favourite. I don't know how to thank you, brother. <br>
QUARK: Ten slips of latinum ought to do it. <br>
ROM: You think he'd mind if I had one for myself? <br>
QUARK: I'd mind. <br>

QUARK: My own brother drinking root beer. It's so human. <br>

ROM: Constable. Care for a root beer? <br>
ODO: No. But you have something I do want. <br>
QUARK: Whatever it is, I didn't do it. <br>
ODO: Don't tell me. Tell the Federation Grand Jury on Inferna Prime. <br>
ROM: Federation Grand Jury? Brother, what have you done now? <br>
QUARK: I haven't done anything. What do they want to talk to me for? <br>
ODO: Oh, I think you know. <br>
QUARK: Odo, I have no idea what this is all about. <br>
ODO: Well then, you'll have eight days to try to guess. We leave
immediately. <br>
QUARK: We? <br>
ODO: I've been waiting ten years for you to get what you deserve. Now
that the big moment is finally here, I wouldn't miss it for anything.
Let's go. <br>

<a href="../StarTrek/49.htm" target="_blank">fizzbin</a>?
<br>
ODO: I don't play cards. <br>
QUARK: I'll teach you. It's a very simple game. <br>
ODO: Let me put it another way. I don't want to play cards. And even if
I did, I wouldn't want to play with you. <br>
QUARK: Afraid you'd lose? You know, Odo, I used to think all your
problems stemmed from the fact that you were a changeling, isolated
from your own kind, forced to live among strangers who didn't
understand you. You couldn't eat, you couldn't drink, you couldn't
sleep, you couldn't make love. Was it any wonder you had such a bad
disposition? But you're not a changeling anymore. You're one of us.
Life is yours for the taking. All you have to do is reach out and grab
it. But do you? No. Because solid or changeling, you're still a
miserable, self-hating misanthrope. That's who you are
and that's who you'll always be. <br>
ODO: I'm still not playing cards with you. <br>
QUARK: Fine. Then we'll just sit here for a week in silence. What are
you reading? <br>
ODO: Nothing that would interest you. <br>
QUARK: Don't be so sure. <br>
(Quark grabs the PADD) <br>
ODO: Quark, give me that. <br>
QUARK: What are you going to do, arrest me? (reads) He walked toward
her, the wooden deck heaving to and fro beneath his booted feet. Her
hands moved to the brooch at her throat. She unclasped it and the cloak
fell from her shoulders, her wet skin glistening in the moonlight.
Lightning flashed and heaven's thunder roared in rhythm with the
beating of their hearts.' <br>
ODO: All right, enough. <br>
QUARK: Odo, I take it all back. You're obviously a lot more complicated
than I thought. If you like that kind of thing I might be interested in
selling you my first edition of 'Vulcan Love Slave.' <br>
ODO: This is work, not recreation. Books like this give me insight into
the criminal mind. It is a well known fact that a high percentage of
homicides are motivated by romantic obsession. <br>
QUARK: Well, no one gets killed in 'Vulcan Love Slave,' but it's still
a hell of a read. <br>
ODO: Give it up, Quark. You can annoy me, bait me, question my very
existence, but in the end, we both know I've won. Because when all is
said and done, I'll be heading back to Deep Space Nine and you'll be
spending the rest of your life in a Federation penal colony. <br>
QUARK: I'm not there yet. Look, Odo, give me a chance. At least tell me
what the charges are. <br>
ODO: I'm afraid I can't do that. This is a high security investigation.
I'm not allowed to discuss the specifics with anyone. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I have some reading to do.

SISKO: At ease, Cadet. <br>
(Sisko gestures to the chair.) <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. <br>
SISKO: I remember my sophomore year. Field studies Starbase one thirty
seven. When I first got there I was a little apprehensive. But it
turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life. <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: Now, the key to field study is simple. Keep your eyes and ears
open, follow orders and try not to get in the way. <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. Very good, sir. I won't let you down. <br>
SISKO: I'd like to say on a personal note, I'm glad that you and Jake
are going to be roommates. <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure the two of you are going to have a lot of fun together.
<br>
NOG: Yes, sir. Time permitting, sir. I mean, if I'm not too busy. After
all I am here to work. Don't worry, sir, I'll look after him for you.
Set a good example. Keep him out of trouble. <br>

NOG: I think I've died and gone to the Divine Treasury. After living in
cadet barracks for the past year, this is going to be paradise. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, I know what you mean. We're on our own now. No one to tell
us what to do. <br>
NOG: Well, before we unpack, we should call maintenance to clean this
place. <br>
JAKE: They were here yesterday. <br>
NOG: If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. I'll
do the cleaning on the odd numbered days, and you'll do it on the even
ones. <br>
JAKE: We're going to clean every day? <br>
NOG: No, just the odd and even ones. I'd better start bringing in my
things. I don't want to be up too late unpacking. <br>
JAKE: So what do you want to do tonight? Dom-jot? Holosuites? <br>
NOG: I wish I could. But once we eat and unpack, it'll be time for bed.
Lights out at twenty two hundred. <br>
JAKE: I haven't gone to bed that early since I was twelve. <br>
NOG: Go to sleep whenever you want. But don't forget, we're hitting the
gym at oh four thirty. <br>
JAKE: The gym? <br>
NOG: Muscles, Jake. You know, those things that're supposed to go
between your bones and your skin? <br>
JAKE: I've heard of them. <br>
NOG: Good. Because by the time I'm done with you, you'll have some of
your very own.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Days have passed. Quark is throwing the round
fizzbin cards onto a seat and Odo is eating soup.) <br>
QUARK: You're doing it again. <br>
ODO: Doing what? <br>
QUARK: Smacking your lips. <br>
ODO: No I'm not. <br>
QUARK: There. Don't you hear that? <br>
ODO: The only thing I've heard for the last four days is you
complaining. <br>
QUARK: This whole runabout is alive with annoying little noises.
Listen. <br>
ODO: To what? <br>
QUARK: That buzzing noise. <br>
ODO: I don't hear a thing. <br>
QUARK: It started over an hour ago. <br>
ODO: If you don't like the noises in here, why don't you go into the
back? <br>
QUARK: Because it's even colder back there than it is up here. <br>
ODO: Quark, leave the temperature controls alone. <br>
QUARK: I will, when I get it right. There it is again. <br>
ODO: What? <br>
QUARK: That buzzing noise. Don't you hear it? <br>
ODO: With all this lip-smacking, how could I hear anything? <br>
QUARK: Where is it coming from? <br>
ODO: Inside your head. <br>
QUARK: Shhh. <br>
ODO: Bzzzzzzzzz. <br>
QUARK: I said be quiet! It's coming from here. <br>
ODO: It's probably a defective anodyne circuit. <br>
QUARK: Defective anodyne circuits make a hissing sound. This is a buzz.
We'd better open up this hatch. <br>
ODO: If this is some kind of convoluted plot to escape. <br>
QUARK: Stop being so suspicious. That's odd. The buzzing's changed
pitch. <br>
ODO: It's gotten louder too. I can hear it now. What could it be? <br>
QUARK: Let's find out. <br>
(Odo unlocks the floor emergency access panel at a console. There's
something alien blinking in the circuitry.) <br>
QUARK: Don't tell me. Let me guess. <br>
ODO: It's a bomb. <br>
QUARK: Next time I tell you I hear something, maybe you'll listen. <br>
ODO: Let's hope there is a next time. I'm going to get a transporter
lock on this thing and beam it out of here. <br>
QUARK: What if it's set to go off if someone tries to transport it? <br>
ODO: What do you suggest? We wait for it to explode? <br>
QUARK: Fine. Beam it out. But at least try and channel the explosion
through the transporter buffer. <br>
ODO: I hope this works. <br>
(The transporter beam starts and BOOM! Quark and Odo are sent flying
and red alert sounds. Monitors are all static.) <br>
QUARK: We did it. We're safe. <br>
(BOOM! And the power goes out) <br>
ODO: Don't be so sure about that. Comm. system's down, navigational
array's failing, environmental controls are badly damaged. We're losing
atmosphere. <br>
QUARK: What now? <br>
ODO: Now we find someplace to land. <br>
QUARK: Land? You mean crash. <br>
ODO: It's either that or wait for our lungs to explode in the vacuum of
space. I'm picking up a class-L planet on long range scanners. <br>
QUARK: Barely habitable. <br>
ODO: More habitable than this thing's going to be in a few minutes. <br>
QUARK: How close? <br>
ODO: Close enough. I hope. <br>
(The planet looks okay, blue oceans and white clouds.) <br>
ODO: If we live through this, whoever planted that bomb is going to
regret it. <br>
QUARK: Believe me, you don't want to get anywhere near the Orion
Syndicate. <br>
ODO: The Orion Syndicate? Is that who the Grand Jury's investigating? <br>
QUARK: I thought you knew. <br>
ODO: If I knew you were involved with the Orion Syndicate, you'd be on
the Defiant right now, surrounded by half my deputies. <br>
(They dive into the atmosphere.) <br>
QUARK: Let me guess. You pretended to know more than you did so I'd
think I had nothing to hide and say something to incriminate myself. <br>
ODO: Something like that. <br>
QUARK: This is all your fault. <br>
ODO: You're the one who's a member of the Orion Syndicate. <br>
QUARK: I'm not a member. I just know people who know people who know
some other people. And besides <br>
(They hit the tree canopy. Blackout, then a little later we see the
runabout is perched on a rocky outcrop.) <br>
QUARK: Will someone adjust the temperature. It's freezing in here. <br>
ODO: Actually, it's freezing out there. <br>
QUARK: Out there? Oh, yeah. Now I remember. You were apologising for
almost getting us both killed. <br>
ODO: If that's how you remember it, you must've hit your head harder
than I thought you did. <br>
QUARK: I guess there's nothing we can do now except send out a distress
signal and wait to be rescued. <br>
ODO: Good plan, except we lost the comm. system in the explosion. <br>
QUARK: That's not good. <br>
ODO: It gets worse. The replicator's been destroyed. From what I can
tell the local plants are poisonous. <br>
QUARK: Then I guess we're stuck with field rations. <br>
ODO: That's right. One package for you. One package for me. The rest <br>
QUARK: I know, I know. Destroyed in the explosion. So now what? <br>
ODO: Now we either freeze to death or starve to death. Take your pick.

JAKE: That's it? That's all you have to say? <br>
NOG: I didn't really read it for content. I mostly corrected your
spelling and grammar. <br>
JAKE: You changed my words? <br>
NOG: Just a few. A preposition here, some punctuation there. <br>
JAKE: You can't change a writer's words without his permission. That's
sacrilege. <br>
NOG: All right. Next time, I'll let you make the changes. <br>
JAKE: There won't be a next time. From now on, if you see my stories
lying around here, don't read them. Don't even touch them. Just leave
them right where they are. <br>

ODO: I thought you were supposed to be repairing the subspace
transmitter. <br>
QUARK: I was. <br>
ODO: What's it doing out here? <br>
QUARK: The signal booster's completely shot. Which means there's no way
we can transmit a distress signal through a planetary atmosphere. <br>
ODO: I see. So you tore it out of the wall in frustration. <br>
QUARK: Actually, I came up with a way to save our lives. All we have to
do is haul this transmitter up to higher ground. More altitude, less
atmosphere. Go high enough, and we might be able to get a signal out. <br>
ODO: How much higher do we have to go? <br>
QUARK: Er, carry the seven, take the square root, times pi. I'd say
that high. <br>

eat, eyeing my customers as they gambled and flirted with the dabo
girls, wishing you were one of them. Not to mention your platonic
friendship with a certain Bajoran Major. <br>

transmitter. <br>
ODO: You are not going to collapse. We're almost to the tree line.
After that, we've only got a few more hours of climbing left before we
can set up the transmitter. <br>
QUARK: A few hours? You mean like three? <br>
ODO: More like six. <br>
QUARK: I could do six. Seven might be pushing it, but six I could do. <br>
ODO: Come on. <br>
(But they've reach a ridge and see there's at least one more ridge and
valley between them and their goal.) <br>
ODO: Forget about six hours. It's more like six days.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Valley]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Heading down) <br>
QUARK: Ten thousand seven hundred and fifty one. Ten thousand seven
hundred and fifty two. <br>
ODO: Quark. <br>
QUARK: Ten thousand seven hundred and fifty three. <br>
ODO: Quark! <br>
QUARK: I just want to know how far we're going. Every step down means
an extra step up. <br>
ODO: Fine. Then count to yourself. I don't want to hear it any more. <br>
QUARK: Fine. But don't talk to me. It's hard keeping track. <br>
ODO: By the time the Grand Jury gets through with you, you'll be
counting years instead of steps. <br>
QUARK: You know what's going to make all this worthwhile? The look on
your face when they let me go. <br>
ODO: Let you go? I don't think so. <br>
QUARK: And you call yourself a detective. The Orion Syndicate tried to
kill me. They never kill their own. They don't need to. Any one of them
would take their own life before they'd testify against the Syndicate.
Don't you get it? I'm not a suspect. I'm a witness. Now you made me
lose count. <br>
ODO: Ten thousand seven hundred and eighty five. <br>
QUARK: Thank you. <br>
ODO: Now let me get this straight. You were never a member of the Orion
Syndicate? <br>
QUARK: I hate to disappoint you. <br>
ODO: But you must have tried to join? <br>
QUARK: I don't want to talk about it. <br>
ODO: Now, if I remember correctly, the Orion Syndicate has a membership
fee. Quite a substantial one. And the Ferengi Commerce Authority did
seize all your assets. Oh it's even worse than that, isn't it? You
never could afford to join, could you? All those years of scheming and
lying and cheating and you're still too small-time for the Orions.
Well, I guess you're not as successful a businessman as you think you
are. <br>
QUARK: Which means you've spent the last ten years of your life trying
to catch a nobody. Without little success, I might add. So you tell me,
which one of us is the bigger failure. Ten thousand seven hundred and
eighty eight. Ten thousand seven hundred and eight nine. Ten thousand
seven hundred and ninety. Ten thousand seven hundred and ninety one.

Captain, may I join you? <br>
SISKO: Be my guest. <br>
ROM: I wanted to ask you about Nog. You know, my son? <br>
SISKO: I think I've met him. <br>
ROM: Have you noticed anything strange about him lately? <br>
SISKO: He seems fine to me. He's just more dedicated than when he left.
<br>
ROM: I've noticed. <br>
SISKO: A year at the Academy will do that to people. <br>
ROM: You think it's the Academy? <br>
SISKO: What else could it be? <br>
ROM: I was afraid he might be a changeling. So while he was asleep, I
drew some blood, just to make sure. <br>
(Rom shakes the vial.) <br>
ROM: It's been eight hours. So far, so good. <br>
SISKO: Rom, he's still your son. He's just taking his duties very
seriously, that's all. <br>
ROM: Nog's moved back in with me, you know. It's horrible. He put me on
report the other day. Said my tool kit was untidy. That's the exact
word he used. Untidy. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't worry about it. He's just going through a phase,
that's all. <br>
ROM: I was hoping living with Jake would relax him. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid Jake's going through a phase of his own. I don't know
what's so difficult about putting a dirty dish back into the
replicator. <br>
ROM: Nog says Jake is a slovenly, undisciplined, unfocused writer. <br>
SISKO: Not an unfair assessment. You know, I sometimes wish Jake had a
little more of Nog's self-discipline. <br>
ROM: And I wish Nog had Jake's ability to enjoy himself. Those two
could learn a lot from each other. <br>
SISKO: If we could only get them in the same room.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Odo and Quark have slept by some rocks.) <br>
ODO: Quark, wake up. We've got a mountain to climb. Quark! Quark?
Quark! Quark. Wake up. Wake up. Wake, wake, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Stop hitting me! <br>
ODO: I thought you were dead. <br>
QUARK: So you saw that as an opportunity to vent years of hostility
towards me? Towards me. Towards me. Hostility. <br>
ODO: What's wrong? <br>
QUARK: What? <br>
ODO: I said what's the matter. <br>
QUARK: I'm deaf. I'm deaf in my right ear. I can't hear anything.
Hello, hello, hello? Hello, hello, hello? <br>
ODO: Would you stop doing that? <br>
QUARK: You don't understand. A one-eared Ferengi is only half a man.
We've got to get out of here. My body's shutting down. It's too cold.
There's not enough to eat. I'm dying. We both are. <br>
ODO: We're not dying. Here, here. You can have the rest of my rations. <br>
QUARK: These aren't rations. These are crumbs. You can't climb a
mountain on crumbs. <br>
ODO: Fine. I'll go by myself. <br>
QUARK: You're going to leave me? <br>
ODO: What do you want me to do? Stay here and trade insults until we
both starve to death? I'd rather take my chances on the mountain. <br>
QUARK: Whose turn is it to carry the transmitter? <br>
ODO: Yours. <br>
QUARK: Figures. Figures? Figures! <br>
(And further on, it is Odo doing the carrying. And nearly falling
backwards under the weight too.) <br>
QUARK: I hate this transmitter and I hate this mountain and most of all
I hate the Orion Syndicate for stranding us here. <br>
ODO: I think we both know who's really to blame. <br>
QUARK: Don't try and blame this on me, Constable. It was your job to
get me to Inferna Prime safely. <br>
ODO: You never told me the Orion Syndicate was after you. <br>
QUARK: You never asked. <br>
ODO: If I had, would you have told me the truth? Or would you have lied
like you lie about everything? <br>
QUARK: Have I ever told you how much I hate that smug, superior
attitude of yours? <br>
ODO: Have I ever told you how much I hate your endless whining, your
pathetic greed and your idiotic little schemes? <br>
QUARK: Well I hate <br>
ODO: What do you hate? <br>
QUARK: You. <br>
ODO: Well that's fine with me, because I hate you too. You're nothing
but a petty thief. <br>
(Odo puts down the transmitter.) <br>
QUARK: You are an arrogant prude. <br>
ODO: Lecher. <br>
QUARK: Freak. <br>
ODO: Fraud. <br>
QUARK: Fascist. <br>
ODO: Failure. <br>
(They start to wrestle each other, shouting Fascist and Failure until
they fall down the slope.) <br>
ODO: Quark? <br>
QUARK: What? <br>
ODO: Are you all right? <br>
QUARK: I'm fine. <br>
ODO: I'm not. My leg is broken. <br>
(Yes, it really shouldn't be bent like that. Quark manages to splint it
with branches and also make a travois.) <br>
QUARK: That should it hold together. Now we just have to get you on it.
<br>
ODO: Stop looking at the leg. You'll pass out again. <br>
QUARK: Not looking at it doesn't help. I still know it's there. <br>
ODO: I should be the one struggling to stay conscious. I'm the one
who's in excruciating pain. <br>
QUARK: Speaking of pain, this is probably going to hurt. <br>
(Quark gets Odo onto the travois.) <br>
ODO: Quark, there's no way you're going to be able to drag me up that
mountain. <br>
QUARK: Just watch me. <br>
ODO: Stop trying to be a hero. You'll get to the top faster if you
leave me behind. <br>
QUARK: Don't you get it? I'm not trying to rescue you. I'm taking you
along as emergency rations. If you die, I'm going to eat you. <br>
ODO: You're joking. <br>
QUARK: Waste not, want not. Comfortable? <br>
ODO: Not really. <br>
QUARK: Join the club. <br>
(Quark struggles on, over rocks, one step at a time, getting closer to
the tree line. Quark tries the transmitter.) <br>
QUARK: Higher. <br>
(Off they go again.) <br>
QUARK: Hold on, Odo, hold on. Hold on. <br>
(The tree line is still above them, mainly because they are filming in
a very small area. Eventually Quark collapses.) <br>
ODO: Quark? <br>
QUARK: It's over. <br>
ODO: What do you mean, it's over? <br>
QUARK: I can't move. We'll have to set up the transmitter here. <br>
ODO: We're not high enough. You have to leave me here and go on by
yourself. <br>
QUARK: Don't you understand? I can't do it. I'm half frozen. I haven't
eaten for days. My muscles won't work anymore. Odo? Say something. <br>
ODO: What is there to say? If we stay here, we're dead. <br>
QUARK: I can't go any further. <br>
ODO: If Sisko were here, do you think he'd give up? Or Worf? Or Dax? <br>
QUARK: They're not here. <br>
ODO: That's right. It's just us. Give me the transmitter. <br>
QUARK: What for? <br>
ODO: Just give it to me. <br>
QUARK: What are you doing? <br>
(Odo has crawled off the travois and is pushing the transmitter along
the ground.) <br>
ODO: What does it look like? <br>
QUARK: You'll never make it. <br>
ODO: Maybe not. <br>
QUARK: You're trying to embarrass me, aren't you? You're trying to
shame me into carrying that thing the rest of the way on my own. Well
it's not going to work. You might as well accept the inevitable and die
with dignity. That's what I'm going to do. I'm just going to lie here
and die. <br>
(Odo can't go any further.) <br>
QUARK: My brother will get the bar. My nephew will be completely
corrupted by the Federation and become a Starfleet captain. And my
bones will lie here and freeze unsold and unmourned. <br>
(Quark gets up.) <br>
QUARK: Try not to break your other leg while I'm gone. <br>
ODO: I'll do my best. <br>
(Quark picks up the transmitter and staggers off.) <br>
ODO: Good luck.
