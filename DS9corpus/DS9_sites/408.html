down. <br>
DAX: The technology looks like something the Cardassians must have
taken from the Romulans. Is that an RCL type one matrix field? <br>
BASHIR: Perhaps we ought to call in a Romulan repair service. <br>
DAX: Or an RCL type two? <br>
BASHIR: Another raktajino? <br>
DAX: It'll keep me up all night. <br>
BASHIR: I can think of better ways of keeping you up. And they're more
fun than drinking Klingon coffee <br>

know a lot about the station. <br>

probably have a faster ship to make their escape. <br>
SISKO: Major, survey all ships in dock with a high warp capability.
Damn! <br>
ODO: What? <br>
SISKO: That's why we've got a residual charge in the graviton

on docking pylons, five smaller ones in the ports. <br>

TANDRO: You're the Chief of Security? <br>
ODO: Are you all right? <br>
TANDRO: My name is Ilon Tandro, special envoy from Klaestron Four in
charge of this extradition procedure. <br>
SISKO: Extradition? I call this kidnapping and assault. <br>
TANDRO: You'll find that to be a valid warrant for her arrest. The
relevant treaty between Klaestron Four and your Federation allows for
unilateral extradition. <br>
SISKO: And the charge? <br>
TANDRO: The fugitive Dax is charged with treason and the murder of my
father.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Security office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: The warrant says Dax was responsible for the
death of General Ardelon Tandro thirty years ago. <br>
SISKO: Thirty years ago? That would've been Curzon Dax. <br>
ODO: when he was on Klaestron Four as a Federation mediator during
their civil war. <br>
SISKO: He never mentioned he'd even been to Klaestron Four. Strange. <br>
ODO: Not so strange considering these charges. <br>
SISKO: Odo, let me tell you something. Curzon Dax tended to be a little
cavalier about life, even about his personal responsibilities from time
to time. I think that was part of the reason I liked him so much. He
had more faults than the usual socially acceptable Trill. He was not a
murderer. <br>
ODO: How about a traitor? It says Dax betrayed the Klaestron government
to the rebels. <br>
SISKO: It's all nonsense, Constable. I'm telling you, I knew the man. <br>
ODO: But did you know the symbiont inside the man?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: Come in. <br>
SISKO: I've sent a subspace message to Klaestron Four requesting
confirmation of the warrant. That's the only stall I could think of.
Now, what the hell's going on, Dax? Dax, if I'm going to help you,
you've got to help me. <br>
DAX: I don't expect any help, Benjamin. Thank you, though. <br>
SISKO: Are you crazy? Treason and murder. On Klaestron Four, either of
those gets you the death penalty. What's the matter with you? Talk to
me before I have to let these people take you. <br>
DAX: No. I'm sorry, Benjamin, but no. <br>
SISKO: We've got eighteen, twenty years of friendship behind us. <br>
DAX: I'm Jadzia Dax now. That was Curzon Dax you knew for twenty years.
<br>
SISKO: So when the Dax part of you survived from one host to the next,
it really didn't take our friendship along. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, you know you're still my very dear friend. I'm sorry. </font></p>

Commander. Now we'd like to be on our way with the prisoner. <br>
SISKO: You know, Mister Tandro, I kept wondering why you tried to
kidnap Lieutenant Dax, rather than just present your warrant to me in
the proper way. I couldn't figure that out at first. <br>
TANDRO: I trust you have figured out, Commander, that our extradition
treaty with your Federation is current and valid. <br>
SISKO: This station is technically Bajoran. <br>
TANDRO: What does that mean to us? <br>
SISKO: You don't have an extradition treaty with Bajor. I think that's
why you tried to abduct Lieutenant Dax. You were afraid the Bajorans
would refuse extradition. <br>
TANDRO: That's absurd. No Bajoran interests are even involved here. <br>
KIRA: How did you know your way around the station so well? <br>
TANDRO: My conversation is with the Commander. <br>
SISKO: No, your conversation is with my First Officer now. <br>
KIRA: You Klaestrons are allies of the Cardassians. Your knowledge of
this station confirms that. They must have given you the layout, which
not only compromises Bajoran security, but also annoys us. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid Bajoran interests are involved, and Bajor is adamant
that. At least I believe it's adamant. <br>
KIRA: Oh, yes. <br>
SISKO: You see. There will have to be an extradition hearing before I
can lawfully release Lieutenant Dax.

QUARK: That's too bad. I'm not shutting down for any Bajoran hearing. <br>
ODO: I'm sure Lieutenant Dax would appreciate it. <br>
QUARK: Business is business. <br>
ODO: You know, that wall's going to have to come in about five metres. <br>
QUARK: What are you talking about? <br>
ODO: Of course, after you move the wall that'll mean your second level
holosuites'll have to come down. <br>
QUARK: Come down? Why? <br>
ODO: New restrictions. <br>
QUARK: Restrictions? <br>
ODO: Building codes. Since the provisional government took over,
they've got their hands into everything and of course, I'm the one
who's expected to enforce their rules here. You know, I think the bar
is just a little too near the exit. <br>
QUARK: This is blackmail. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I was just coming to see you. We still
haven't found a place for the hearing. Holding it on Bajor would
involve Dax leaving the station and I don't want to risk that. <br>
ODO: Well, now that's a coincidence. Our good friend Quark just donated
the use of his facility for the hearing. <br>
SISKO: Nice gesture. <br>
ODO: I thought so. <br>
SISKO: You know, I haven't been able to get a word out of Dax about any
of this. So I thought someone might go do some investigating on
Klaestron Four itself. What do you think? <br>
ODO: This case has thirty years of dust covering it. The extradition
hearing'll take about thirty minutes. <br>
SISKO: I'm hoping to make it a little longer than that. <br>

RENORA: This will be an informal hearing, so I'm going to start with
some informal advice. I am one hundred years old. I do not have time to
squander listening to superfluous language. In short, I intend being
here until supper, not senility. Understood? <br>
TANDRO: Understood, Madame Arbiter. <br>
RENORA: You seek the extradition. Make your case. <br>
TANDRO: The accused Trill, whatever its present appearance may be, was
and is a Federation officer who committed capital crimes on our planet.
Since there is no time limit on the prosecution of such crimes <br>
RENORA: Thank you, I've already read the warrant and charges. The
crimes described are thirty years old. What took you so long? <br>
TANDRO: The evidence was contained in military files which were
officially sealed until recently. <br>
RENORA: Fine. Sit. Commander, the warrant is in order. On what grounds
do you ask that I deny extradition? <br>
SISKO: You say the warrant's in order. But the name on the warrant is
Dax. Certainly that doesn't refer to Jadzia Dax, a female, but to the
now deceased Curzon Dax, a male. This young woman wasn't even born
thirty years ago. <br>
TANDRO: You are arguing semantics. This creature is a Trill. The
symbiont known as Dax has progressed from one host to the next. <br>
SISKO: Exactly. From one host to the next. A different host, a
different person. So I submit that the person he wants to extradite no
longer exists, and I challenge him to prove otherwise. <br>
TANDRO: That's ridiculous. <br>
RENORA: It would have been easier on me, Commander, had you not raised
that particular point. But the penalty for these crimes on your planet
is death, and that is rather permanent. So before I grant extradition,
you will convince me please, that the person named in your warrant is
the person who is standing here now.

you to find all the medical evidence you can to support the theory that
Jadzia Dax and Curzon Dax are two entirely separate people. Major <br>
BASHIR: Excuse me, sir. I don't know that there is any medical evidence

SISKO: Assume there is, then find it. Major, I'm not asking you to be
an attorney here, but if you could check the Federation computers for
any precedents, legal decisions involving Trills. <br>
KIRA: Is a Trill responsible for the conduct, for the acts of it's
antecedent selves. <br>
SISKO: Right. That kind of thing. <br>
KIRA: What if I find the answer's yes? <br>

no. But if you do find a wrong answer, I want to see it. I can't fight

CREWMAN [OC]: Commander Sisko, there's a subspace communication from
Odo on Klaestron Four. <br>
SISKO: We only have a few hours, people. <br>
(Kira and Bashir leave) <br>
SISKO: Constable What've you got for us? <br>
ODO [on monitor]: Well, I know two things so far. Whoever did murder
that General Ardelon Tandro, it got his troops so mad they went out and
won their civil war. They made the General a national hero. There are
statues of him all over the place. Second, everyone that's old enough
to remember says the General and Curzon Dax were the closest of
friends. Comrades, inseparable. <br>
SISKO: Now that sounds like the Curzon Dax I knew. <br>
ODO [on monitor]: But treason, plus the murder of his own best friend?
Strange business. If those charges are true, I'd want to hang Curzon
Dax up by his heels myself. <br>
SISKO: Thanks for the confidence. <br>
ODO [on monitor]: Don't worry, I'll do my job. The General left a
widow. If the two men were that close, she has to remember something
about Curzon Dax that's not in the record. You'll hear from me.

ODO: You're certain of that? <br>
ENINA: Without a doubt. <br>
ODO: But your own son <br>
ENINA: My son is obsessed with the death of a father he never knew. Ohm
I tried to persuade him not to reopen the case. He wouldn't listen to
anyone, least of all to me. You have to understand. Curzon Dax was
closer to the General than other any man on this planet. He was a dear
friend to this family. Curzon would have died himself sooner than
conspire against my husband. <br>
ODO: Is that a personal opinion or are there any facts that would
support this. <br>
ENINA: The only facts I know are in my son's hands and he intends to
use them against Dax. <br>
ODO: It might help my people to know what they are. <br>
ENINA: There is proof of a secret transmission that was made from out
military headquarters to the enemy camp. It identifies exactly the
route my husband was taking on his way back from the capital to the
front. It was at that time that he was ambushed and kidnapped. A short
time later, he was killed. <br>
ODO: Then your son must believe that Dax made the transmission. <br>
ENINA: There were only five people including my husband who knew that
route. My son has established the whereabouts of all of them at the
time of the transmission. All of them, except Curzon. <br>
ODO: So Dax has no alibi. <br>
ENINA: That cannot possibly be enough to convict him, can it? <br>
ODO: I don't know. Thank you. You've been helpful. <br>
ENINA: How is he? <br>
ODO: Ma'am? <br>
ENINA: Curzon Dax. <br>
ODO: He's gone. The Dax your son is trying to extradite is Jadzia Dax,
a twenty eight year old woman. Curzon Dax died two years ago. Jadzia is
the new host. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TANDRO: Madame Arbiter, I call on the expert
knowledge of another Trill, Selin Peers. Minister Peers, we're
fortunate to have you with us. <br>
RENORA: Excuse me. It also seems rather convenient to have you with us.
How do you come here? <br>
PEERS: Because another Trill is involved, the Trillian government
requested that I be present during the extradition. <br>
RENORA: And do you know the accused personally? <br>
PEERS: I do not. <br>
RENORA: We accept you as an expert on Trills. Proceed. <br>
TANDRO: Minister, through how many hosts have you survived? <br>
PEERS: The symbiont within me has survived through the adult lifetimes
of seven hosts. <br>
TANDRO: Do you remember your very first host? <br>
PEERS: Of course. It was a woman, as a matter of fact. <br>
TANDRO: Do you remember what you thought and felt when you were joined
with your first host? <br>
PEERS: Yes. The symbiont does carry memories of times shared with
previous hosts. <br>
TANDRO: So if a crime is committed by a Trill, then the symbiont's next
host would remain aware of it, would recall that crime? <br>
PEERS: Yes, absolutely. <br>
TANDRO: Would recall the details of it. <br>
PEERS: Yes, absolutely. <br>
TANDRO: And would still feel the guilt of it. <br>
PEERS: Oh, yes. <br>
SISKO: Madame Arbiter, this is not a trial and Mister Tandro is not the
prosecutor. <br>
RENORA: Mister Tandro, you have made your point. <br>
TANDRO: I don't believe that I have, Madame Arbiter. The real point is
that Commander Sisko would have you endorse his idea of a perfect Trill
crime. To commit it, all one has to do is elude capture long enough to
change hosts, and then he or she can go free. <br>
SISKO: Minister Peers, you said you were with your first host
throughout her adult life. <br>
PEERS: Yes. <br>
SISKO: So, before a symbiont is joined with any host, that host has
already lived a significant portion of his or her life from birth to
what age, sir? <br>
PEERS: Early to mid-twenties. <br>
SISKO: Why not younger? <br>
PEERS: To give the prospective host the chance to develop, mature. They
have to be old enough to make an informed judgement as to whether or
not they really want to be joined. <br>
SISKO: And once they are joined, this host's personality is completely
suppressed by the symbiont? <br>
PEERS: Oh, no. No, it's a joining. It's a total sharing, a blending, of
both host and symbiont. Neither is suppressed by the other. <br>
SISKO: So with each new host there does come in fact, a new
personality, a new combined person. A different person. <br>
PEERS: From that standpoint, yes. <br>
SISKO: Well I for one don't know from what other standpoint we could be
talking about. Thank you, Minister. <br>
TANDRO: Just to return us to what's important here, Madame Arbiter, the
accused can remember any crimes she committed as Curzon Dax and nothing
can be truthfully asserted in this hearing that can alter that fact. <br>
SISKO: Yes, the memories were passed to an entirely new host, to an
entirely different person. <br>
TANDRO: This is outrageous. You can't let Dax get away with murder. <br>
RENORA: Gentlemen, I said this would be an informal hearing, not
riotous. We will take a two hour recess. <br>
(Later) <br>
RENORA: The answer seems simple enough to me. Split her down the
middle. Send the symbiont back to stand trial and keep the host here. <br>
BASHIR: I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that. <br>
RENORA: Oh, what a surprise. Please enlighten me. <br>
BASHIR: The symbiont and the host are biologically interdependent.
Ninety three hours after they've joined, neither can survive without
the other. <br>
RENORA: I see. Proceed, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Doctor, you've heard the arguments. From a medical viewpoint,
are Curzon Dax and Jadzia Dax the same person. <br>
BASHIR: Certainly not. Aside from the gender change, there's a marked
difference in blood types, metabolisms, nervous system, height, weight.
<br>
TANDRO: This is not at all relevant. <br>
BASHIR: What is relevant, sir, is my analysis of the brain waves of
Curzon and Jadzia Dax. <br>
SISKO: Madame Arbiter. <br>
(Sisko gives her a PADD) <br>
BASHIR: As you can see, they are distinctly different, which clearly
illustrates that Curzon and Jadzia are two unique individuals. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
TANDRO: Doctor, I've looked through your research myself. It's quite
impressive for such a young man. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
TANDRO: As a layman, there are obviously things I don't fully
understand. <br>
BASHIR: I'd be happy to explain anything you wish. <br>
TANDRO: Yes? Well, exactly how does the Trill brain work? <br>
BASHIR: It's quite complicated, actually. First of all, there are two
cerebral nuclei. <br>
TANDRO: Two? <br>
BASHIR: One in the symbiont and one in the host. <br>
TANDRO: Two brains. And these two brains talk to each other? <br>
BASHIR: Like two computers linked together. <br>
TANDRO: That's very clear, Doctor. Thank you. Now, in your
investigations, were you able to analyse the separate wave patterns
from each of these brains? <br>
BASHIR: They don't function separately. <br>
TANDRO: I didn't ask you how they function, Doctor Bashir. I asked if
you could analyse the two distinct patterns. <br>
BASHIR: I just don't see the relevance of <br>
TANDRO: Could you? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
TANDRO: And have the brainwave patterns of the symbiont changed since
it joined with its new host? <br>
BASHIR: With the available evidence, there's no way of telling. <br>
TANDRO: What's your best guess? <br>
BASHIR: I wouldn't care to guess. <br>
TANDRO: In fact, is there evidence of any change at all in the symbiont
since it joined with this new host? Yes or no. <br>
BASHIR: (big pause) No. <br>
TANDRO: Thank you, Doctor Bashir. You've been very helpful. <br>
RENORA: Any more witnesses, Commander Sisko? <br>
SISKO: Yes, Madame Arbiter. I'd like to call the one person in this
courtroom who knew Curzon Dax. Me. <br>
RENORA: You know where the witness stand is. <br>
SISKO: With your permission, I'd like Major Kira will direct the
questions. <br>
KIRA: Tell us a little about Curzon Dax, Commander. <br>
SISKO: He probably wasn't the ideal Trill. He drank a little too much.
He could be more interested in women than maybe he should've been. <br>
KIRA: I thought he was your friend. <br>
SISKO: I'm simply pointing out that he was not at all like the young
woman in this courtroom. <br>
KIRA: What was, exactly, your relationship with Curzon Dax? <br>
SISKO: He took a raw young Ensign under his wing and taught me to
appreciate life in ways I'd never thought about before. He taught me
about art and science and diplomacy. Whatever sense of honour I might
have today, he nurtured. Treason, murder. He was not capable of those
things. <br>
TANDRO: As you've already said, Commander, this is not a trial. <br>
SISKO: I'm describing my friend, Curzon Dax. A man I knew very well. On
the other hand, I can't tell you too much about my new friend there.
We're really just getting to know each other. <br>
TANDRO: Commander, Starfleet officers do have the reputation of being
honourable and I judge you to be an honourable man. As an honourable
man, do you think this crime should go unpunished? <br>
SISKO: I prefer no crime to go unpunished. <br>
TANDRO: Then, if it were possible, even you would not argue with
punishing the symbiont part of Dax. <br>
SISKO: How can you be so sure that the symbiont was the criminal
influence? What if it were the Curzon host that was responsible? Then
the surviving symbiont would be completely innocent. <br>
TANDRO: No. They'd both be guilty. You yourself have argued that the
two personalities, once joined, function as one. Your own Doctor Bashir
confirmed it. When you put salt in water, the two become
indistinguishable and inseparable. <br>
SISKO: I think you've just made my point for me. When the water boils
off, the salt returns to its original state. Pour that same salt into
another liquid, and you have something completely different. Jadzia Dax
is an entirely new entity. <br>
RENORA: Following a one hour recess, Lieutenant Dax will take the
witness chair. One hour. <br>
(Renora leaves) <br>
SISKO: If you won't defend yourself, you're not going to testify. <br>
KIRA: It's a hearing, not a trial. She has no choice. <br>
(A crewman hands Kira a PADD) <br>
KIRA: Odo's on subspace. It's urgent.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO [on monitor]: I've made some progress. <br>
SISKO: Good. <br>
ODO [on monitor]: Not good. Since the transmission to the enemy is the
key evidence, I thought it might be a good idea to go through all the
communications logs from headquarters during that period. I even found
Curzon Dax's records. <br>
SISKO: You can't tell me Curzon would log in a communiquÃ© to the enemy.
<br>
ODO [on monitor]: No. Nothing like that. But the log shows a number of
conversations between Dax's office and General Tandro's home. <br>
SISKO: They were close friends. <br>
ODO [on monitor]: A number of the conversations took place when the
General was away at the front. <br>
SISKO: The wife? <br>
ODO [on monitor]: The wife. <br>
SISKO: Curzon Dax and Enina Tandro. <br>
ODO [on monitor]: Maybe it was innocent. Maybe he was just providing a
little emotional support during tough times. Or maybe they were taking
advantage of the General's absence to get a little closer. If they were
having an affair, that translates into a pretty solid motive for
murder.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: The conversations were just the beginning.
I've also found records of gifts, of holidays spent at an inn outside
the capital. <br>
ENINA: What purpose does this serve? <br>
ODO: It serves the truth. <br>
ENINA: The truth. <br>
ODO: If there's more to this than meets the eye, I hope you'll explain,
because as it stands, this will severely hurt Dax's defence. <br>
ENINA: My husband was not the hero in life that he was in death, Mister
Odo. In death he became a legend, and I became a legend's wife. There
are people who did not even know my husband who still contact me.
Decades after his death, they still mourn him. <br>
ODO: But you don't. <br>
ENINA: No, because I knew the man before he became a legend. But I also
knew my place in history. My place is to carry on bravely, never to
remarry, to represent my husband at the banquets given in his name. But
never, never to talk about who he really was, because nobody wants to
hear that. <br>
ODO: They may have to hear it now. <br>
ENINA: No matter what is said, they will still embrace his memory, for
he was and will always be, the hero who died for his people. But
perhaps it's time for my place in history to change.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: You've been protecting her reputation.
That's it, isn't it? That's why you won't even defend yourself. There
are worse things than an illicit love affair. Curzon didn't murder
anybody. He didn't commit treason. Are you really willing to commit
suicide over something done in another lifetime? That is what you're
doing, you know. My God, Dax. Young Tandro, that wouldn't be your son? <br>
DAX: You have an overactive imagination, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: Then what is it that's holding you back? Help me. Damn it, if
you were still a man. <br>
(Sisko hits a support pillar instead) <br>
DAX: I see your temper hasn't improved. <br>
SISKO: Don't talk to me about my temper. <br>
DAX: Curzon always warned you about it. <br>
SISKO: You're not going to get me off track here. <br>
DAX: Do you remember that Argosian lieutenant who threw a drink in your
face? <br>
SISKO: And you knocked me down with a right cross before I could kill
him. I still have a little scar here from your ring finger. <br>
DAX: I tried on that ring on after Curzon died. It just slipped off my
finger. <br>
SISKO: If you don't help me, old man, they're going to take you because
I don't know any more arguments. <br>
DAX: Then allow it to happen. <br>
SISKO: It is my an obligation to protect the lives of those in my
command. You ought to know that. You taught it to me. <br>
DAX: That was Curzon. <br>
SISKO: I'll stop trying to protect you the minute you tell me Curzon
was guilty of these charges. <br>
DAX: I won't discuss it with you. As for Enina Tandro, yes, I feel the
shame of Curzon's indiscretions. When one of my kind stumbles,
Benjamin, it is a mistake that's there forever. I can't tell you which
part of Curzon Dax couldn't stop himself from acting shamefully with
another man's wife. I can tell you that he did love her, for whatever
that's worth. <br>
SISKO: Enough to kill her husband? <br>
DAX: So you are questioning? <br>
SISKO: What else can I do? <br>
DAX: Nothing, Benjamin. Nothing at all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quark's]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RENORA: Lieutenant Dax, you're either two hundred
years older than I am or you're about the same age as my great
granddaughter. At first I wondered which of those you were. Now I am
bothered by the likelihood that you may be both. Let's finish this,
Commander. <br>
SISKO: At what age did the host, Jadzia, first want to be joined as a
Trill? <br>
DAX: I wanted it since I was a child. I worked very hard for it. <br>
SISKO: The competition to become a Trill is very strong, then, among
potential hosts. <br>
DAX: Yes. It's considered a great honour. <br>
SISKO: How did young Jadzia finally become a host candidate? <br>
DAX: By winning scholarships, competing against other young people.
You're tested in countless ways. <br>
SISKO: Including psychological tests, to determine the strength of
character of the prospective host. Is that true? <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
SISKO: And the young Jadzia excelled in those tests of academics and
character, of psychological stability. <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
SISKO: If you can remember other things, remember that as well. What
academic degrees do you hold, Lieutenant? <br>
DAX: I hold Premier Distinctions in exobiology, zoology, astrophysics
and exoarchaeology. <br>
SISKO: How many of those degrees did you earn before you being joined
with the symbiont Dax? <br>
DAX: All of them. <br>
SISKO: All of them. As Jadzia. Alone. This brilliant and independent
young woman has done nothing in her life but contribute to her society.
Madame Arbiter, how can anyone justify trying her for a crime allegedly
committed by another entity before she was even born? <br>
TANDRO: This will only take a minute. Lieutenant, as a Trill candidate,
did Jadzia fully understand the responsibilities to be assumed upon
becoming a Trill, and did you willingly accept those responsibilities,
and whatever consequences they might entail? <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
TANDRO: And would that not obviously include the consequences of
criminal acts committed by Curzon Dax? <br>
(Enina enters with Odo) <br>
ENINA: May I speak? <br>
RENORA: And you are? <br>
ENINA: I am Enina Tandro, widow of General Ardelon Tandro. This hearing
is unnecessary. The accusations are erroneous. <br>
TANDRO: Mother, what are you talking about? <br>
ENINA: Madame Arbiter, Curzon Dax is accused of sending a transmission
to the enemy that betrayed my husband. But I know where Curzon was at
the exact time that transmission was sent. He was in my bed. <br>
RENORA: Mister Tandro, you will want to re-examine your extradition
request. Until then this hearing is adjourned. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Promenade - upper level]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ENINA: You were kind to try and protect me. Someone
you'd never even met. <br>
DAX: There's much of Curzon that's still a part of me, that still
remembers what you had together. <br>
ENINA: But it was Curzon Dax who swore himself to silence to preserve
the memory of General Tandro. Not Jadzia. <br>
DAX: I felt it was important to keep that promise. The General's memory
is cherished by your people. <br>
ENINA: And it will continue to be. No one will ever know that he was
the one who tried to betray us, and that the rebels killed him for the
favour. As for you, there is one favour I would ask. <br>
DAX: Of course. <br>
ENINA: Live, Jadzia Dax. Live a long, fresh and wonderful life. </font>
