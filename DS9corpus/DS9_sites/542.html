BASHIR: Thank you. Nurse. <br>
ODO: You're up late. <br>
BASHIR: Ah, yes, I've got a few things to finish up before I leave in
the morning. I'm presenting a paper at a medical conference. <br>
ODO: I see. Where is it? Risa, Casperia Prime? <br>
BASHIR: Casperia. How'd you guess? <br>
ODO: Well, Doctors always hold their conferences at sunny resorts. <br>
BASHIR: Ours is a grim profession. Don't you think we deserve a break
from all the illness and death? <br>
ODO: Well, don't forget to take plenty of sunscreen. <br>
(O'Brien arrives in his kayaking wetsuit.) <br>
ODO: Oh, let me guess. You dislocated your shoulder. <br>
(Odo leaves.) <br>
BASHIR: Not again. <br>
O'BRIEN: Afraid so. <br>
BASHIR: You promised me that you wouldn't go kayaking again until your
shoulder had a chance to heal. <br>
O'BRIEN: I know, but I can't stay away. It's like the river calls to
me. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, it's saying, stay away. Don't come near me. I'll only hurt
you more! <br>

O'BRIEN: Ow! Much better. <br>
BASHIR: It'll be tender for a few days, so go easy on it. <br>

BASHIR: If the pain gets any worse, Nurse Bandee'll give you something.

BASHIR: He doesn't look too happy. <br>
ODO: No, he doesn't. <br>
(Sisko and his visitor come out.) <br>
SISKO: All right, people. This is Deputy Director Sloan of Internal
Affairs. He's here under the authority of the Federation Council. I
expect you all to give him your full cooperation. <br>
SLOAN: Starfleet Intelligence has reason to believe that there's been a
security breach aboard Deep Space Nine. It appears that someone has
been passing information to the Dominion. <br>
DAX: With all due respect, I think there's been some kind of mistake. <br>
SLOAN: I hope you're right, Commander. I really do. But until we
determine the source, we have to follow standard containment procedures
and isolate all members of the senior staff. <br>
SISKO: As of now, you're all relieved of duty and confined to quarters.
<br>
KIRA: Confined to quarters? <br>
SISKO: I don't like it any more than you do. <br>
SLOAN: You'll be contacted shortly. I'll be conducting interviews with
each one of you. For the time being, you are not to discuss this matter
amongst yourselves. Any questions? <br>
BASHIR: How long do you think your investigation's going to take? <br>
SLOAN: That's difficult to say, Doctor, but don't worry. We've already
informed Starfleet Medical that you won't be attending your conference.
<br>
BASHIR: Oh, that's very considerate of you. <br>
SLOAN: Take them to their quarters. <br>

SLOAN: Thank you. <br>
(Chandler leaves.) <br>
SLOAN: Doctor Bashir. Have a seat, please. I'm sorry you had to miss
your medical conference. It couldn't be helped. In a case like this, I
have to follow strict procedures. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, I understand. <br>
SLOAN: Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. The last time you tried to
attend a medical conference you were taken prisoner by the Dominion. <br>
BASHIR: An experience I wouldn't care to repeat. <br>
SLOAN: I'm sure you wouldn't. Five weeks in a Dominion prison camp? I
can't imagine what that must have been like. <br>
BASHIR: Not pleasant. <br>
SLOAN: I read your report. It made me ask myself how I would have held
up under those conditions. I guess you never really know until you go
through it. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure you would have been able to cope. We do what we have
to to survive. <br>
SLOAN: I was just reading over some of your case reports. Fascinating
stuff. The work you did with those genetically enhanced patients. Very
impressive. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
SLOAN: Before you started working with them, Starfleet Medical
described them as alienated, uncommunicative and hostile. You were the
first doctor who managed to establish a dialogue with them. <br>
BASHIR: Well, actually I think the fact that I'm genetically enhanced
myself made them a little more open to accepting me. <br>
SLOAN: You spoke their language. <br>
BASHIR: Exactly. <br>
SLOAN: I envy your profession. You have a positive impact on people's
lives. You know, I considered becoming a doctor myself. <br>
BASHIR: You have a good bedside manner. Actually, when I came in here,
I half suspected that I would be interrogated under a very bright
light. <br>
SLOAN: Not this time. Well, I see no need to trouble you any longer.
Thank you for your cooperation. <br>
(Chandler enters.) <br>
BASHIR: My pleasure. <br>
SLOAN: Lieutenant Chandler will take you back to your quarters now. I'm
afraid I'm going to have to ask you to stay there until I've finished
with the rest of the interviews. <br>
BASHIR: Well in that case, maybe you could send someone to take a look
at my replicator. It's not working. <br>
SLOAN: Actually, we took them offline. To prevent anyone from trying to
replicate a communications device or a weapon. <br>
BASHIR: Oh. Well, I just wanted some breakfast. <br>
SLOAN: What would you like? I'll have it sent right to your quarters. <br>
BASHIR: Hot buttered scones, moba jam and some red leaf tea, please. <br>
SLOAN: Coming right up. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
SLOAN: Doctor, one more thing. Those genetically enhanced patients of
yours. Did Starfleet Medical ask you to work with them, or did you
volunteer? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, I volunteered. <br>
SLOAN: I see. Very good.

BASHIR: Two hours? About what? <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: About you. <br>
BASHIR: You're joking. <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: I only wish I were. Every single question was
about you. Look, I'd better go before they trace this transmission. I
just wanted to warn you to watch your back. <br>

BASHIR: Yes, I did. <br>
SLOAN: Good. I was going over my notes from our last conversation and
there are a couple of things I'd like you to clarify. <br>
BASHIR: Oh? <br>
SLOAN: Do you have a problem with that? <br>
BASHIR: Not at all. <br>
SLOAN: Let's go back to the time you spent with the Dominion. <br>
BASHIR: I wasn't with the Dominion. I was their prisoner. <br>
SLOAN: You were held at Internment Camp three seven one? <br>
BASHIR: That's right. <br>
SLOAN: Barrack six? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
SLOAN: And you were there five weeks? <br>
BASHIR: Thirty seven days, actually. <br>
SLOAN: You're absolutely sure about that? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
SLOAN: And General Martok was with you in barrack six? <br>
BASHIR: Correct. <br>
SLOAN: He said that the Jem'Hadar removed you from the barracks. <br>
BASHIR: I complained when they cut our rations, so they threw me in
solitary. <br>
SLOAN: I see. And did you meet with anyone during that week? <br>
BASHIR: I was alone. <br>
SLOAN: Are you sure about that? <br>
BASHIR: Wait, let me think. Was I alone in solitary? Yes. I think I
was. <br>
SLOAN: You didn't meet with a Vorta? <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
SLOAN: Or a changeling? <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
SLOAN: So, you're telling me that you spent seven days in complete
isolation? <br>
BASHIR: it wasn't seven days, it was five. Five days. <br>
SLOAN: Now that's odd, because General Martok said you were gone for
seven days. <br>
BASHIR: He's wrong. It was five. <br>
SLOAN: Why would he lie about something like that? <br>
BASHIR: He wasn't lying. <br>
SLOAN: You can't both be right. <br>
BASHIR: He must have lost count of the days. He was under a great deal
of stress. <br>
SLOAN: And you weren't? <br>
BASHIR: Human beings are more adaptable to incarceration than Klingons.
<br>
SLOAN: Especially when they're genetically engineered? <br>
BASHIR: Meaning what? <br>
SLOAN: Let's move on to the matter of your escape from the camp. I'll
quote from your own report. We constructed a transmitter using
components from the barracks' life support system. We used it to
contact our runabout and beam ourselves out of the camp. Forgive me,
Doctor. That sounds a little hard to believe. <br>
BASHIR: It's what happened. <br>
SLOAN: Why would the Dominion leave your runabout orbiting the camp
unattended? <br>
BASHIR: They didn't think we'd be able to contact it. <br>
SLOAN: Why not? They left you everything you needed to build a
transmitter. Isn't it more plausible that the Dominion wanted you to
escape? <br>
BASHIR: Why? Why would they do that? <br>
SLOAN: So that you could start working for them. <br>
BASHIR: But I'm not working for them. <br>
SLOAN: How can you be sure? <br>
BASHIR: Excuse me? <br>
SLOAN: How can you be sure you're not working for them? Are you
familiar with the term engramatic dissociation? <br>
BASHIR: Vaguely. <br>
SLOAN: The theory holds that if a person's mind is sufficiently
disciplined, he'd be capable of compartmentalising contradictory
information, believing one thing while doing another. I think you
possess that kind of mind. I think the Dominion saw that and decided to
take advantage of it. I think they broke you and turned you to their
cause, and then had you suppress the memory of what happened. <br>
BASHIR: You're saying I'm a Dominion spy and don't even know it? <br>
SLOAN: What could be more perfect? There's no chance of your getting
caught because you don't even realise you're working for them. When
they want to debrief you, all they do is trigger your memory. <br>
BASHIR: That's ridiculous. <br>
SLOAN: Doctor, I am trying to help you, but I need your cooperation. I
need you to tear down the walls inside your mind and dredge up a
fragment of a memory, anything about your mission, your contacts. I
know it's not easy, but you've got to try. <br>
BASHIR: There are no memories to dredge up. I'm not suffering from
engramatic dissociation. I'm a loyal Starfleet Officer, and will not
answer any more questions unless I'm formally charged and can respond
with the benefit of counsel. <br>
SLOAN: I've had enough of your lies, Doctor. You think you're smarter
than the rest of us, don't you? You think you're smarter than the
millions of brave men and women who put their lives on the line for the
Federation. You want to do things the hard way, fine, but I'm going to
get the truth out of you, and when I'm done I'm going to take
whatever's left of you and lock it away. Guards!

I lost a lot of friends. <br>
BASHIR: I lost a lot of friends, too. <br>
CHANDLER: I believe that, but yours were Jem'Hadar. <br>
(Chandler takes Bashir's comm. badge) <br>
CHANDLER: You won't be needing this anymore. Step inside. <br>
(After the break.) <br>
CHANDLER: With all due respect Captain, if you would just wait in the
Security office, Director Sloan should be here any minute and you can
discuss your request with him <br>
SISKO: There is nothing to discuss. I want ten minutes alone with my
officer, and I want them now. <br>
CHANDLER: Very well. <br>
(Chandler leaves.) <br>
SISKO: I thought you should know Odo did some checking. Sloan had a son
in Starfleet. He was a transport pilot. He was killed by a Dominion
patrol. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe he thinks I supplied them with the information that
helped them target his son's ship. <br>
SLOAN: That's exactly what I think. When my son's convoy dropped out of
warp to rendezvous with a Klingon bird of prey, they found three
Dominion attack ships waiting for them instead. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry for your loss. But don't you think that your son's
death indicates a conflict of interest in your investigation? <br>
SLOAN: I think it gives me an added incentive to go after the truth.
Now what was it you wanted? <br>
SISKO: I need to talk to my Chief Medical Officer in private. <br>
SLOAN: I can understand that. But security protocol require that no one
talk to the prisoner without clearance from me. <br>
SISKO: Director Sloan, have you received orders from Starfleet to
relieve me of my command of this station? <br>
SLOAN: No, I haven't. <br>
SISKO: Well then, as long as I remain in command, I will see Doctor
Bashir whenever I please. Furthermore, from now on I will sit in on all
interrogation sessions to make sure his rights are observed. Do I make
myself clear? <br>
SLOAN: I believe so. Well, we'll see each other tomorrow. In the
meantime, enjoy your conversation. <br>
(Sloan leaves.) <br>
BASHIR: I appreciate your help, sir. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko is also present for this interview.) <br>
SLOAN: Let's go back a few years to the incident at <a href="475.htm" target="_blank"> Bopak
Three</a>. According to your report, you and Chief O'Brien crash
landed on the planet, where you then made contact with a group of
Jem'Hadar. <br>
BASHIR: We didn't make contact with them. They captured us. <br>
SLOAN: If that's the case, why didn't you attempt to escape? <br>
BASHIR: We didn't have a chance. <br>
SLOAN: According to Chief O'Brien, you were more interested in curing
the Jem'Hadar of their addiction to Ketracel White. <br>
BASHIR: I'm a doctor. They were suffering from withdrawal. <br>
SLOAN: They're the enemy. Genetically engineered killing machines. <br>
BASHIR: They're not machines, they're sentient beings, and I couldn't
just stand there and watch them die. <br>
SLOAN: Why? Because you felt sympathy for them, being genetically
engineered yourself? <br>
SISKO: This is irrelevant. We're talking about an incident that
happened before Doctor Bashir allegedly became a Dominion agent. <br>
SLOAN: It's not irrelevant, Captain. If anything, it shows that he was
already sympathetic to the Dominion. But let's move on. Doctor, we
spoke yesterday about a group of <a href="533.htm" target="_blank"> genetically enhanced patients</a>
that you brought to the station. Why, exactly, did you decide to work
with them? <br>
BASHIR: They'd been institutionalised most of their lives. I thought I
might find a way to help them assimilate into society. <br>
SLOAN: A laudable goal, but what I find puzzling is the way you went
about it. These misfits had been sheltered from the outside world for
as long as they could remember, yet you chose to bombard them with
information about the war with the Dominion. Frankly, I'm surprised it
didn't scare them into a deeper isolation. <br>
BASHIR: I wanted to engage them, and it worked. <br>
SLOAN: Is that why you convinced Starfleet Command to give them access
to classified battle plans? <br>
BASHIR: Starfleet was interested in hearing our ideas on how to win the
war. <br>
SLOAN: How to win the war? You recommended that the Federation
surrender. <br>
BASHIR: We were looking for ways to save as many lives as we could.
Now, if you'd take the time to examine the findings <br>
SLOAN: Captain, you took the time to examine the findings, didn't you? <br>
SISKO: I did. <br>
SLOAN: Did you agree with them? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
SLOAN: Of course not. No loyal Starfleet officer could. <br>
SISKO: I won't deny that Doctor Bashir has made some questionable
decisions in his career, but that's a long way from convincing me that
he is a traitor. So far, your case is based on circumstantial evidence
and speculation. <br>
SLOAN: What other kind of case can I make against a man who covers his
tracks so well? <br>
SISKO: That's a circular argument and you know it. <br>
SLOAN: Captain, if Doctor Bashir had been involved in one or two
questionable incidents, I could understand how you might be able to
dismiss it, but the sheer number of incidents form a pattern of
behaviour that can't be ignored. I understand you want to be loyal to a
man who's served under you for so long. I understand you'd be inclined
to take his word over that of an outsider. But step back for a moment
and think about it. This man concealed the truth about his <a href="514.htm" target="_blank"> illegal genetic
enhancement</a> for over thirty years. He lied to get his medical
licence. He lied to get into Starfleet. He lied to you when he came
aboard this station and he's been lying to you ever since. <br>
SISKO: He did eventually come forward and tell the truth. <br>
SLOAN: That's right, he did. Why? Why? What made you confess? Was it
because you realised that it was your duty to be honest with your
captain? <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
SLOAN: Was it because you felt guilty about having lied to him for so
long? <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
SLOAN: Then why did you come forward? <br>
BASHIR: I was found out. <br>
SLOAN: And if you hadn't been found out, would you have come forward
and told your captain the truth, ever? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know. <br>

him, he either thinks I'm lying or repressing my memories. <br>
SISKO: I know you're not lying, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: But? <br>
SISKO: But, as a doctor, isn't it in the realm of medical possibility
that the Dominion did recruit you and that you have blocked it out of
your memory? <br>
BASHIR: Even if it is possible, it didn't happen. You don't believe me.
<br>
SISKO: I don't think you're lying, Julian. It's late. Try to get some
sleep. We'll talk again in the morning. <br>
(Later, Bashir is woken by the lights coming on full.) <br>
SLOAN: Sorry to interrupt your sleep, Doctor. It looks like you're
going on a little vacation after all. <br>
BASHIR: Where are you taking me? <br>
SLOAN: Starbase fifty three for further questioning. <br>
BASHIR: Does Captain Sisko know about this? <br>
SLOAN: It's none of his concern. Not anymore. <br>
BASHIR: You have no right to do this, Sloan. <br>
SLOAN: Oh, but I do. Starfleet Special Order six six seven one five
gives me the authority to neutralise security threats to Deep Space
Nine by whatever means necessary. Doctor, you're about to spend the
rest of this war in a maximum security cell. Unless you would care to
put your thumbprint on this confession. We can reword it if it doesn't
meet your exacting standards. <br>
BASHIR: You can take that confession and throw it out of the nearest
airlock. <br>
SLOAN: I thought so. Take him to the shuttle. <br>
(Chandler lowers the forcefield.) <br>
KAGAN: Would you put your hands in front of you, Doctor? <br>
(A transporter beam engages.) <br>
SLOAN: He's beaming out! Stop him!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cardassian ship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEYOUN: Good evening, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Weyoun? <br>
WEYOUN: Welcome home. It would appear we got you out just in time. It's
all right, you're among friends now. Did they mistreat you? I don't see
any bruises. <br>
BASHIR: Why did you bring me here? <br>
WEYOUN: What choice did I have? Starfleet discovered you were working
for us. <br>
BASHIR: I'm not working for you. I'm not a Dominion spy. <br>
WEYOUN: You actually believe that, don't you? That's why you're such a
good operative. <br>
BASHIR: You're lying. <br>
WEYOUN: Oh, here we go again. These little conversations of ours always
follow the same pattern. You start out confused, then you get angry,
then you deny everything until finally the walls inside your mind start
to break down and you accept the truth. <br>
BASHIR: What truth? That you broke me when I was in the prison camp? <br>
WEYOUN: We're not barbarians. There was no torture involved. We simply
helped you to see that there's no way Starfleet can defeat the
Dominion. And because you didn't want billions of Federation citizens
to lose their lives needlessly, you agreed to provide us with
information that would help us end this war quickly. You rose above the
petty question of whose side you were on and made a moral decision.
It's not
surprising, really. After all, you are a doctor. <br>
BASHIR: You're saying that I'm a traitor. <br>
WEYOUN: Traitor, hero, those are just words. Oh, your friends on Deep
Space Nine may vilify you, but history will judge you to be a great
man, a visionary who helped bring an end to one of the most devastating
wars the galaxy has ever seen. <br>
BASHIR: But I don't remember, I don't remember any of it. <br>
WEYOUN: Of course not. You suppressed the memories, compartmentalised
them. It's a remarkable ability, but it does make these initial
conversations a bit wearing. Have something to eat. You always
re-integrate better on a full stomach. <br>
(Scones, jam and a cup of hot tea.) <br>
WEYOUN: Do you remember the first time I offered you scones back at the
camp? <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
WEYOUN: Concentrate. Sensory details are the key. I had you brought in
from solitary. You were very hungry, but you refused to give me the
satisfaction of seeing you eat. Do you remember? <br>
BASHIR: I don't remember because it never happened. <br>
WEYOUN: You were almost there. Try again. With a little more effort you
can break through. <br>
BASHIR: I am not a Dominion spy! <br>
WEYOUN: I can see this is going to be one of our more difficult
sessions. <br>
BASHIR: I'm innocent. I don't care what you or Sloan think. Wait a
minute. Why would you both be trying to convince me of the same lie?
Unless you were working together. <br>
WEYOUN: Please, Doctor. Listen to yourself. <br>
BASHIR: Sloan's the traitor. <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Combat stations. Enemy ship approaching. <br>
(It's the Defiant on Weyoun's monitor.) <br>
WEYOUN: Sisko. (Boom) I'm afraid we're going to have to continue your
debriefing later. <br>
(Weyoun leaves.) <br>
(Boom! Bashir and a Cardassian are thrown to the floor, then Worf and
Kira beam in. The Cardassian is killed.) <br>
BASHIR: Am I glad to see you. <br>
KIRA: Away team to the Defiant. We've got him.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I suppose you have a reasonable explanation
for why the Dominion broke you out of that holding cell. <br>
BASHIR: I understand how this must look, sir. <br>
SISKO: What did they want? <br>
BASHIR: Weyoun just tried to convince me that I was his operative. I
think he and Sloan are working together. <br>
SISKO: Now that's enough. You know you're not going to exonerate
yourself by casting suspicions on someone else. <br>
BASHIR: Well maybe he's not a traitor, maybe he's been replaced by a
changeling. All I'm saying is that both he and Weyoun are trying to
frame me. <br>
WORF: You have run out of excuses, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: You have to believe me. I'm innocent. <br>
SISKO: I have had enough of your lies, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: You can't just dismiss what I'm saying, because if I'm right
there's no telling what kind of damage Sloan <br>
SISKO: Get him off my bridge. <br>
KIRA: Let's go, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Jadzia, you believe me, don't you? <br>
DAX: Why did you do it, Julian? <br>
BASHIR: Miles? You? <br>
(Bashir puts his hand on O'Brien's shoulder. O'Brien pushes it away
vigorously.) <br>
BASHIR: Your shoulder. It's all right. <br>
O'BRIEN: Of course it's all right. <br>
BASHIR: But you dislocated it yesterday when (pause) we were playing
springball. <br>
O'BRIEN: So? It's better now. <br>
BASHIR: You didn't hurt it playing springball. You dislocated it
kayaking in a holosuite. You're not Miles. And you're not Captain
Sisko. He'd at least be willing to hear me out. This isn't real. It
can't be. <br>
(The Bridge fizzes out to become) <br></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Holodeck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sloan is in black leather, not a Starfleet
uniform.) <br>
SLOAN: You're right, Doctor. None of it was real. But I am. And this
isn't over. Congratulations, Doctor. It's not often that we're proven
wrong. <br>
BASHIR: I take it you finally believe I'm not working for the Dominion.
<br>
SLOAN: I'm leaning heavily in that direction. But to erase any
lingering doubts, what do you say we make one final test? <br>
BASHIR: I'm finished playing games with you, Sloan. <br>
SLOAN: I assure you, Doctor, this is no game. <br>
(Sloan hands a device to a guard, who approaches Bashir with it) <br>
SLOAN: Don't be afraid. I have no intentions of hurting you. I just
need to remove an implant from behind your right ear. I tell you what.
Why don't you do the honours? Give it to him. Go ahead, Doctor. It's
only a neuro-synaptic relay. <br>
BASHIR: You've recorded my neuroelectric responses? <br>
SLOAN: That's correct. And now I'd like to check the findings in order
to confirm what I already believe. That you're an innocent man. Now
either you remove the relay or we will. <br>
(Bashir takes a chip out from behind his ear.)<br>
SLOAN: Thank you. This'll only take a moment. <br>
(Sloan puts the chip on a tricorder.) <br>
BASHIR: Take your time. I don't seem to be going anywhere. <br>
SLOAN: I'm glad to see your sense of humour's returning. That's a very
good sign. <br>
BASHIR: Of what? <br>
SLOAN: You're beginning to relax. We subjected you to high levels of
stress to ensure accurate test results. I'm glad to say the results are
in your favour. Your loyalty to the Federation appears to be above
reproach. <br>
BASHIR: Why do I still detect a hint of doubt in your voice? <br>
SLOAN: Frankly, I would have preferred to have kept you under
observation a little longer. Unfortunately, we didn't know about Chief
O'Brien's injury or we would've incorporated that into the programme. <br>
BASHIR: So you beamed me out of my quarters into this holosuite when I
was asleep. <br>
SLOAN: I believe we allowed you a full hour. <br>
BASHIR: No wonder I feel so tired. I suppose you find your subjects
more malleable when they have been deprived of sleep. <br>
SLOAN: Not a new technique, I admit, but an effective one nonetheless. <br>
BASHIR: So, why don't you tell me who you are? Who you work for? <br>
SLOAN: I would think it's obvious. The same people you work for. The
Federation. Starfleet. <br>
BASHIR: You don't expect me to believe you're with Internal Affairs, do
you? <br>
SLOAN: No, of course not. Internal Affairs is a competent department,
but limited. <br>
BASHIR: So which department are you with? <br>
SLOAN: Let's just say I belong to another branch of Starfleet
Intelligence. Our official designation is Section thirty one. <br>
BASHIR: Never heard of it. <br>
SLOAN: We keep a low profile. Works out better that way for all
concerned. <br>
BASHIR: And what does Section thirty one do, apart from kidnapping
Starfleet officers? <br>
SLOAN: We search out and identify potential dangers to the Federation. <br>
BASHIR: And once identified? <br>
SLOAN: We deal with them. <br>
BASHIR: How? <br>
SLOAN: Quietly. <br>
BASHIR: So if I had been a Dominion agent, what would have happened to
me? <br>
SLOAN: We wouldn't be standing here having this conversation. <br>
BASHIR: And Starfleet sanctions what you're doing? <br>
SLOAN: We don't submit reports or ask for approval for specific
operations, if that's what you mean. We're an autonomous department. <br>
BASHIR: Authorised by whom? <br>
SLOAN: Section thirty one was part of the original Starfleet charter. <br>
BASHIR: But that was two hundred years ago. Are you telling me you've
been working on your own ever since? Without specific orders?
Accountable to nobody but yourselves? <br>
SLOAN: You make it sound so ominous. <br>
BASHIR: Isn't it? Because if what you say to me is true, you function
as judge, jury and executioner, and I think that's too much power for
anyone. <br>
SLOAN: I admit it takes exceptional people to do what we do. People who
can sublimate their own ambitions to the best interests of the
Federation. People like you. <br>
BASHIR: Me? <br>
SLOAN: You have all the qualifications to be a very useful member of
Section thirty one. <br>
BASHIR: A few minutes ago, you were calling me a traitor and now you
want to recruit me? <br>
SLOAN: Well, you're intelligent, you're resourceful, you've always been
fascinated by covert operations. Why else would you spend so much time
in Quark's holosuites playing spy? <br>
BASHIR: You're serious. <br>
SLOAN: We're on the same team. We believe in the same principles that
every other Federation citizen holds dear. <br>
BASHIR: Yet you violate those principles as a matter of course. <br>
SLOAN: In order to protect them. <br>
BASHIR: No, I'm sorry, but the ends don't always justify the means. <br>
SLOAN: Really. How many lives do you suppose you've saved in your
medical career? <br>
BASHIR: What has that got to do with anything? <br>
SLOAN: Hundreds? Thousands? Do you suppose that those people give a
damn that you lied to get into Starfleet Medical? I doubt it. We deal
with threats to the Federation that jeopardise its very survival. If
you knew how many lives we've saved, I think you'd agree that the ends
do justify the means. I'm not afraid of bending the rules every once in
a while if the situation warrants it, and I don't think you are either.
<br>
BASHIR: You've got the wrong man, Sloan. <br>
SLOAN: I don't think so. In time, you'll come to agree with me. <br>
BASHIR: Don't hold your breath. <br>
SLOAN: All I ask is that when you get back to Deep Space Nine, you
consider what I've said. <br>
BASHIR: What if I decide to expose you? <br>
SLOAN: Let's just say I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. <br>
(A guard hypo's Bashir.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Captain's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: I'll say one thing for this fellow Sloan, he's
clever. He timed the Doctor's abduction to coincide with his trip to
the medical conference. That way, he wasn't missed. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, he's clever. <br>
KIRA: We went over Julian's quarters but we couldn't find any residual
transporter signatures. So either they got him off the station some
other way, or they have transporter technology that we can't detect. <br>
BASHIR: Captain, is there any word from Starfleet about Sloan or
Section thirty one? <br>
SISKO: There's no record of a Deputy Director Sloan anywhere in
Starfleet. And as for Section thirty one, that's a little more
complicated. Starfleet Command doesn't acknowledge its existence, but
they don't deny it either. They simply said they'd look into it and get
back to me. <br>
BASHIR: When? <br>
SISKO: They didn't say. <br>
KIRA: That sounds like a cover up to me. <br>
BASHIR: I can't believe the Federation condones this kind of activity. <br>
ODO: Personally, I find it hard to believe they wouldn't. Every other
great power has a unit like Section thirty one. The Romulans have the
Tal Shiar, the Cardassians had the Obsidian Order. <br>
BASHIR: But what does that say about us? When push comes to shove, are
we willing to sacrifice our principles in order to survive? <br>
SISKO: I wish I had an answer for you, Doctor. <br>
KIRA: Maybe we should do some checking, try to track down this Sloan
ourselves. <br>
ODO: That won't be easy. If he's right and Section thirty one has
existed since the birth of the Federation, they've learned to cover
their tracks very well. <br>
SISKO: We don't have to find them. They'll come to us. You said that
Sloan tried to recruit you. <br>
BASHIR: I turned him down. <br>
SISKO: He doesn't strike me as a man who takes no for an answer. And
next time he asks you to join his little group, you will say yes. <br>
ODO: Well, congratulations, Doctor. Looks like you're going to get to
play a spy after all. Only this time, for real. </font> </p>
