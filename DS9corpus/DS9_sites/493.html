MAN: Here they are. Welcome. <br>
WOMAN: Thank you. <br>
PADD: Recording. <br>
JAKE: Character sketches for possible stories. A Bolian tries to
impress a dabo girl by wearing a toupee. A thief disguises himself as a
Monk so he can swindle a Ferengi. A woman travelling alone. She's come
a long way. <br>

crying.) <br>
ODO: Lwaxana? <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, hello, Odo. <br>
ODO: You've been crying. <br>
LWAXANA: I can't help it. <br>
ODO: Why? <br>
LWAXANA: Because. <br>
(She stands up to show off her big belly.) <br>
LWAXANA: I'm pregnant. <br>
(After the titles, Odo has picked his jaw up off the floor.) <br>
LWAXANA: It's a miracle. I never thought I could have another baby. <br>
ODO: Then those were tears of happiness? <br>
LWAXANA: I won't let him do it, Odo. <br>
ODO: Who? What? <br>
LWAXANA: My husband, Jeyal. He wants to take my baby. That's why I ran
away. <br>
ODO: Please, Lwaxana, try to be calm. Now tell me, why would your
husband want to take your baby from you? <br>
LWAXANA: He's Tavnian. <br>
ODO: And? <br>
LWAXANA: They believe in strict separation of the sexes. Boys are
raised by men, girls by women. Why, those poor children aren't even
told the other sex exists until they're sixteen. <br>
ODO: And your child is male? <br>
LWAXANA: And the day Jeyal found out, he said that he was going to take
my baby away from me as soon as he was born. Well, I told him that that
isn't what we'd agreed, that he had said it was going to be different
with us because I wasn't Tavnian. <br>
ODO: But he changed his mind. <br>
LWAXANA: During our wedding ceremony, he spoke so beautifully about why
he wanted to marry me, but afterwards it was as if I had become a piece
of property in his eyes. <br>
ODO: So you ran away. <br>
LWAXANA: And it wasn't easy, believe me. Toward the end, I was
practically a prisoner in my own house. <br>
ODO: Well, now that you've shown your husband how determined you are to
be part of your boy's life, perhaps he'll reconsider his position. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, no. Not Jeyal. He's the most wilful man I've ever met. I'm
so tired. I've never needed a friend more than I do right now. <br>
ODO: I appreciate your situation, and I would like to help. <br>
LWAXANA: I knew you would. You're such a dear, sweet man. <br>
ODO: Unfortunately, I'm also a very busy man. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh believe me, Odo, the last thing I want is to become a
burden to you. I know how you value your privacy. All I want is a quiet
place where I can have my baby in peace. <br>
ODO: I was about to suggest the very thing. I'll find out when the next
transport leaves for Betazed. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, I couldn't possibly go there. That's the first place Jeyal
will look for me. I know him. He won't give up. Not until he finds me
and gets his son back. That's why I came to you. Because I knew you'd
protect me. You will protect me, won't you, Odo? </font></p>

ONAYA: You're a writer. I could see you were somewhere else. Some place
you were inventing. <br>
JAKE: I'm working on a story. <br>
ONAYA: I can spot a creative soul a galaxy away. My name is Onaya. <br>
JAKE: Jake Sisko. <br>
ONAYA: Do you live here? <br>
JAKE: Yes. <br>
ONAYA: I love Cardassian architecture, the way things flow together.
Kell used to say that every element had to be of a piece, yet have a
beauty all it's own. <br>
JAKE: Tavor Kell the architect? <br>
ONAYA: I knew him when he was in exile. <br>
JAKE: What was he like? <br>
ONAYA: He was shy, unsure of himself and his talent. Most people would
never notice someone like him, but I have a weakness for artists. <br>
JAKE: You wouldn't think he was shy from his designs. <br>
ONAYA: When I first met him, they were as timid as he was. I was always
telling him to stop censoring himself. <br>
JAKE: He must've listened to you. <br>
ONAYA: I've found artists have a weakness for me as well. At least, I
hope they do. <br>
JAKE: I, er, I've always wondered what Kell would have designed if he'd
lived to be older. <br>
ONAYA: He accomplished more in the years that he had than most people
could in a dozen lifetimes. His name is known throughout the quadrant.
His buildings will stand for centuries to come. Isn't that what an
artist wants, to be remembered? Isn't that why you write? <br>
JAKE: I don't know. I think it's mostly because I like to tell stories.
<br>
ONAYA: There's no reason to hide your ambition, Jake. It's nothing to
be ashamed of. I think it's what makes artists so compelling. <br>
JAKE: All right. I guess I do want to be remembered. <br>
ONAYA: So what are you doing to make sure you will be? <br>
JAKE: Well, I'm thinking of going to the Pennington School, on Earth. <br>
ONAYA: You already have the talent inside you. I can see it. You just
need someone to help you bring it to the surface. <br>
JAKE: How? <br>
ONAYA: There are ways. Exercises. Techniques. <br>
JAKE: Can you show them to me? <br>
ONAYA: Come to my quarters tonight. <br>

SISKO: Are you packed? Kasidy's ship is going to be here any minute. <br>
JAKE: Dad, I was thinking about staying home. <br>
SISKO: Staying home? This trip was your idea. <br>
JAKE: I know. <br>
SISKO: You really want to pass up three days in the Bajoran outback? <br>
JAKE: I thought maybe you and Kasidy would have a better time without
me. <br>
SISKO: Oh, lay off the matchmaking, Jake. Kasidy and I are doing fine. <br>
JAKE: It's not just that. I'm also working on this story and I don't
want to lose my concentration. <br>
SISKO: You can write on the trip. Look, I'm not trying to talk you into
anything. I don't get leave often, and I was looking forward to the

for love was nothing more than a prison. <br>
(Dax and Kira are medieval maidens, Worf is in his mok'bara gear and
Lwaxana has talked them into melancholia.) <br>
LWAXANA: So, tell me, where are you girls headed? <br>
KIRA: Oh. A holosuite. <br>
DAX: King Arthur's Court. <br>
LWAXANA: Camelot. Love betrayed. Dreams shattered. <br>
(At the bar.) <br>
QUARK: Look at them. You'd think somebody died. I don't know if it's
because she's Betazoid or what, but her mood is contagious. As soon as
she walked in here, things started getting quiet. <br>
ODO: What do you want me to do about it? <br>
QUARK: Either cheer her up or get her to leave. Because if you don't,
I'm going to throw her out. <br>
(Odo goes over to the table with the black cloud over it.) <br>
ODO: Ahem. <br>
LWAXANA: Odo. Won't you join the party? <br>
ODO: Actually, I have some free time and I was wondering if you wanted
to take a walk. <br>
WORF: I would. <br>
ODO: I meant Lwaxana. <br>
LWAXANA: I'd love to. Sorry. Maybe next time. <br>

carry on like that. I'm sorry. <br>
ODO: No, don't apologise. I think I finally understand why you're so
determined not to let your husband take the baby from you. <br>
LWAXANA: These are your quarters, aren't they? <br>
ODO: Yes. Right next to yours. <br>
LWAXANA: My replicator is acting up. Would you mind terribly if we
popped in so I could get a cup of Gavaline tea? <br>

ODO: Yes. Actually, most people think it's a sculpture. <br>
LWAXANA: Well, what do most people know? Thank you. May I ask you
something, Odo? Are you over her? Don't worry, I'm not going to throw
myself at you if you say yes. <br>
ODO: Major Kira and First Minister Shakaar are involved now. <br>
LWAXANA: How sad. <br>
ODO: Not at all. I'm happy for her. <br>
LWAXANA: Well, just don't go do what I did. Look for someone to fix
your broken heart then end up pregnant and on the run. <br>
ODO: I don't think there's too much danger of that happening. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh! <br>
ODO: What is it? <br>
LWAXANA: The baby kicked. May I sit down for a minute? <br>
ODO: I don't have any furniture. <br>
LWAXANA: The floor'll do. <br>
ODO: How are you feeling now? <br>
LWAXANA: Like a changeling who's had to hold his shape too long. <br>
ODO: Ah. Well I think I know how that feels. <br>
LWAXANA: He's moving. Here, you want to feel? There! <br>
ODO: Yes! <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, I'm so tired, Odo. I don't think I've had a decent night's
sleep in weeks. Sometimes, with Betazoid babies, you can actually sense
their thoughts. Such contentment. <br>
ODO: Yes, I can feel it, too. <br>
LWAXANA: Someone once said life is a search to find the peace you once
had when you were safe inside your mother. <br>
ODO: I didn't have a mother. <br>
LWAXANA: Don't worry, it's all right. You'll find your peace, just the
same. <br>

LWAXANA: No. <br>

ONAYA: It's what you're going to be writing next that interests me. You
seem nervous, Jake. <br>
JAKE: Maybe a little. <br>
ONAYA: That's understandable. You should be nervous when you start
something new. Although maybe not this nervous. Haven't you ever been
alone in a woman's quarters before? Whatever you're thinking, put it
out of your mind. You're here to work. <br>
(She settles him on the settee) <br>
ONAYA: Now, what's the most ambitious story you ever wanted to tell? <br>
JAKE: I have an idea for a novel. It's sort of autobiographical. The
main character's mother dies. It's not about that really. It's about a
lot of things. <br>
ONAYA: So many it all seems so big to you right now. You're afraid that
you can't do it justice? <br>
JAKE: Yeah. <br>
ONAYA: But I'll bet you know what the first line is. <br>
JAKE: How'd you know that? <br>
ONAYA: I have something I want to show you something. <br>

ONAYA: Revalus used it when he wrote The Wait. <br>
(It's a pen.) <br>

ONAYA: I told you I have a weakness for artists. I want you to have it.
<br>
JAKE: I don't know what to say. Thank you. <br>
ONAYA: There's more. <br>
(She moves the PADD aside and replaces it with stack of paper.) <br>
ONAYA: Here. <br>
JAKE: Paper. I've never worked on paper before. <br>
ONAYA: Revalus used to say that a writer should put pen to paper as if
he were a painter putting brush to canvas. It's part of what he called
visceral writing. <br>
JAKE: What's that? <br>
ONAYA: It's one of the techniques I told you about. <br>
JAKE: Can you teach it to me? <br>
ONAYA: That's why you're here. <br>

ONAYA: Isn't it? The opening line of your novel. Write it down. <br>
(Jake writes - From my window it looked like the ) <br>
ONAYA: Now keep going. <br>
JAKE: What do you mean, keep going? <br>
ONAYA: Write whatever comes to you. The idea is to create a stream of
consciousness and see where that takes you. You can edit later. Just
write the first thing that comes to mind. I won't look. <br>
(She starts to stroke the back of his neck and head.) <br>
ONAYA: Let the words tumble out of you. Don't censor them. Feel the pen
in your hand, the texture of the paper. Let yourself fall into a
rhythm. You feel where my thumbs are? That's your foramen magnum. It's
a focal point of the body's bioelectric field. There's another one
here. (his temples) The Vulcans call them qui'lari. The Indians of
ancient Earth called them shakras. I know how to stimulate them to make
you feel restful or energised or even creative. <br>

flooded my ) <br>
JAKE: This isn't bad. <br>

him up to you. <br>
JEYAL: Her intentions do not concern me. As her husband, I have a legal
right to my son. <br>

established that the male child is considered the property of the
mother's husband. <br>

claim to the baby. <br>
LWAXANA: I don't quite know what to say. I'm just touched by your
willingness to do this for me. <br>
ODO: It's not so much, really. We'll remain husband and wife for a few
months, long enough to satisfy Tavnian law, and then get an annulment
of our own. It's not as if I was planning to marry someone else. <br>
LWAXANA: Even so, thank you. <br>
ODO: There is one thing I don't understand. Jeyal insisted on staying
to witnessing the ceremony. <br>
LWAXANA: He did? <br>
ODO: Is that a problem? <br>
LWAXANA: In a Tavnian wedding, the groom must stand before the bride
and tell her why he wants to marry her. And then, in front of his
family and friends, he must proclaim his love for her and convince her
to accept him as her husband. <br>
ODO: Well, I trust I can count on you to accept me even if I just stand
there and read last week's Criminal Activity Report. <br>

myself. I didn't need anyone else and I took pride in that. The truth
is, I was ashamed of what I was, afraid that if people saw how truly
different I was they would recoil from me. Lwaxana saw how different I
was and she didn't recoil. She wanted to see more. For the first time
in my life, someone wanted me as I was. And that changed me forever.
The day I met her, is the day I stopped being alone. And I want her to
be part of my life from this day on. Marry me, Lwaxana. Let me into

QUARK: Ladies and gentlemen, please do me the honour of accompanying me
to my humble establishment. I'm throwing a party for the happy couple. <br>
DAX: Quark! <br>
QUARK: What can I say? I'm a hopeless romantic. <br>
(The witnesses leave.) <br>
ODO: Are you all right? <br>
LWAXANA: We did it. He's really leaving. <br>
ODO: It would appear so. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, Odo, you were wonderful. You know, for a minute there, I
really believed you wanted to marry me. I suppose that we should tell
them the truth. But let's wait till after the party.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jake is still writing and Onaya is near sated on
his creativity.) <br>
ONAYA: Jake, you should rest. <br>
JAKE: Not now. I'm onto something. <br>
ONAYA: Your father will be home soon. You should be there. <br>
JAKE: I'll see him later. <br>
ONAYA: Enough. <br>
(She takes the pen from him.) <br>
JAKE: What'd you do that for? <br>
ONAYA: You're pushing yourself too hard. <br>
JAKE: No, I'm not. My mind has never been so clear. Everything is
coming together. At this rate, I can finish this novel in a few days. <br>
ONAYA: And you will. I promise you. But if you rest now, your work will
be even better. <br>
JAKE: All right, I'll go home. Maybe get some sleep. <br>
ONAYA: You'll come back later? <br>
JAKE: Of course. I need you.

BASHIR: Something has stimulated Jake's brain functioning in a way that
I have never seen. The capillaries in his cerebral cortex have dilated
twenty percent. Neurotransmitter production is up by at least that
amount, and neural activity is off the scale. <br>
SISKO: Do you have any idea what caused it? <br>
BASHIR: Not yet, but it's a good thing we got him here when we did. His
cortex was on the verge of synaptic collapse. <br>
SISKO: But he is going to be all right? <br>
BASHIR: I'd like to keep him in a neural stabilisation field for a
while. <br>
JAKE: Onaya. <br>
SISKO: Jake. <br>
JAKE: Where is she? <br>
SISKO: Jake, what happened? I'm going to go talk to Odo, see if he
knows anything about this Onaya. <br>
BASHIR: I'll let you know if his condition changes. (to nurse) I'll be
in the lab. <br>
(Later, as Nurse Patricia Tallman is tending to Jake, a golden glow
comes through the wall, solidifies into Onaya and knocks her out.) <br>
ONAYA: Come with me, Jake. It's time to finish what we started. <br>
(Later again, CSI O'Brien is scanning the wall) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm picking up concentrated traces of some sort of psionic
energy on the bulkhead. <br>
BASHIR: The tests I ran indicated that Jake's mental activity was
stimulated by some kind of psionic phenomenon, possibly telepathic in
nature. <br>
SISKO: Then this entity Nurse Tagana saw could have been responsible. <br>
BASHIR: We have to find it, then get Jake back in the neural
stabilisation field before it's too late. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll tell Odo to have his search parties reconfigure their
tricorders to scan for psionic energy. <br>
BASHIR: That'll help, but only for a while. Psionic residue decays
within minutes. <br>
SISKO: Then we'd better get moving.

Onaya.) <br>
ONAYA: Keep going, Jake. The moment I saw you, I knew you were worthy
of what I could give you. But I can't stay with you forever. This is
your chance to create something that will live on, long after you're
gone. <br>
(Jake's nose starts bleeding again, so Onaya gives him a handkerchief.)

JAKE: I can't. <br>
ONAYA: Let me help you. <br>
(She holds the paper and his right hand for him.) <br>
ONAYA: That's better, isn't it? <br>
(She goes back to taking his golden energy. Sisko jumps through the
upper hatch.) <br>
SISKO: Get away from him. <br>
JAKE: Dad, don't interfere. <br>
SISKO: I said get away. <br>
(Onaya does.) <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Ops. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
SISKO: Lock on to my signal and stand by to beam Jake directly to the
Infirmary. <br>
KIRA [OC]: You're too close to the reactor core. There's so much
interference I can't get a lock. <br>
SISKO: Get a medical team down here immediately. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Aye, sir.<br>
SISKO: What are you? <br>
ONAYA: It's not what I am that matters, it's what I do. You don't know
the minds I've touched.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus" target="_blank">Catullus</a>, <a href="../StarTrek/2.htm" target="_blank">Tarbolde</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keats" target="_blank">Keats</a>. a hundred others. I
unlocked their potential. <br>
SISKO: Is that what you did to Jake? Look at him! <br>
ONAYA: They all die in the end, but look what I gave them in return.
Immortality. Their names will live on forever. <br>
SISKO: And you, what do you get out of it? <br>
ONAYA: What I need to survive so I can go on, find others and unlock
their talents as well. He was the youngest I ever found. So eager,
ready to give everything he had in one great burst. What a waste. I
will never forget you, Jake. <br>
(Onaya starts to turn into golden energy.) <br>
SISKO: You're not going anywhere. <br>
(Sisko's phaser has no effect. The ball of energy flies through the
bulkhead and off into space.)

for Betazed leaving this afternoon. I'm going home. <br>
ODO: I thought you were planning on having the baby here? <br>
LWAXANA: If I did, I'd end up staying for months and that wouldn't be
fair. I've imposed on you enough. <br>
ODO: Lwaxana, you could deliver at any time now, and it's a long way to
Betazed. You really should stay. <br>
LWAXANA: I'll miss you, too. <br>
ODO: Then why leave? <br>
LWAXANA: You've gotten used to having me around, haven't you? Oh, you
dear, sweet man. Don't you see? What you want is company, someone to
take care of. <br>
ODO: Is that so wrong? <br>
LWAXANA: No, of course not. The problem is I want much more than that
from you. You see, I can't help it. I'm still in love with you. And as
much as I wish that you were in love with me, I know you're not. I
could stay, I try to make you fall in love with me, but we both know
that won't happen. Then I'd end up resenting you, and our friendship is
far too important for me to let that happen. That's why it's better for
both of us if I leave now. <br>

SISKO: How are you feeling? <br>
JAKE: Okay, I guess. You've read it? <br>
SISKO: I just finished. <br>
JAKE: What'd you think? <br>
SISKO: You've got a good start on a novel here, Jake. The dialogue is
sharp, the story's involving, the characters are real. The spelling is
terrible. I especially liked the father. <br>
JAKE: Remind you of anyone? <br>
SISKO: A bit. It's really good. <br>
JAKE: I know. I just wish I wrote it. <br>
SISKO: You did. <br>
JAKE: How can I be sure? I mean, without Onaya. <br>
SISKO: Listen to me. You wrote these words, not her. <br>
JAKE: But she got them out of me. <br>
SISKO: And that means they were somewhere inside you. And all you have
to do is learn to find them for yourself. <br>
JAKE: You're right. But I got to tell you, I don't feel up to writing
just yet. <br>
SISKO: That's understandable. Take it easy for a while. You'll get back
to it. And then, someday, when you're ready, maybe you'll finish it. <br>
JAKE: Sounds like a plan. <br>
SISKO: I've got to get to work. I'll check in on you in a couple hours.
<br>
JAKE: I'll be here. <br>

under it he writes by Jake Sisko.) </font> </p>
