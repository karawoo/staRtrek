through a large decorative window. Apparently he's just been thrown
through by Julian, wearing a tuxedo and an air of nonchalance. A blonde
in a red dress offers him a bottle of champagne. In it's dark glass he
sees the reflection of his assailant approaching from behind. Bashir
turns and fires the champagne cork at him, knocking the man out cold.) <br>
BASHIR: Lot of kick for a forty five Dom. <br>
CAPRICE: Thank you, Mister. Mister? <br>
BASHIR: Bashir. Julian Bashir. <br>
(Well, it's the right initials, and he does get a round of applause as
he kisses the woman.) <br>
CAPRICE: Who's that? <br>
BASHIR: An uninvited guest. Excuse me. <br>
(Bashir goes over to ) <br>
BASHIR: Nice tux. <br>
GARAK: Thank you. <br>
BASHIR: Now get out. <br>
GARAK: But Doctor, I've only just arrived. <br>
BASHIR: Breaking into a holosuite during someone's programme is not
only rude, it's illegal. I should call Odo and have you arrested. <br>
GARAK: What an extreme reaction that would be. You must be very
embarrassed by this programme. <br>
BASHIR: I'm not embarrassed. I'm annoyed that you have intruded into my
privacy. <br>
GARAK: Privacy, indeed. I think it goes far deeper than that, Doctor.
Ever since you received this new programme, you've spent virtually
every free hour in the holosuite. But you haven't told anyone what the
programme is. <br>
BASHIR: Am I supposed to? <br>
GARAK: No, no, no. But you're such a, forgive me, a talkative man and
it's so unusual for you to have secrets. <br>
BASHIR: I must have picked up that habit from you. Now, if you will
excuse me. <br>
GARAK: Is this fantasy of yours really truly revealing of your inner
psyche? <br>
BASHIR: What? <br>
GARAK: Is that why you're so protective? Are you afraid that I'll find
out some humiliating secrets about the real Julian Bashir? <br>
BASHIR: This is a fantasy. I'm not hiding anything. <br>
GARAK: Well, if you've nothing to hide, then why not let me stay? <br>
BASHIR: All right. Now I have to be at work in two hours and I'd like
to enjoy myself, so keep quiet and don't rain on my parade. <br>
GARAK: Your parade? <br>
BASHIR: Never mind. <br>
GARAK: Don't worry, Doctor. I can be quite discreet. You'll barely know
I'm here. <br>
BASHIR: Good. <br>
GARAK: But if I may make one observation. <br>
BASHIR: Garak. <br>
GARAK: I only want to point out that your lovely companion is leaving.
Odd. She seemed so interested in your advances just a moment ago. I
wonder what scared her away? Oh, no. I do apologise. You must be
incensed. In fact, if I were in your shoes, I would grab a bottle of
champagne and shoot me. <br>
BASHIR: I can see I'm going to regret this. <br>
GARAK: Don't worry, Doctor. We're going to have a wonderful time. After
all, what could possibly go wrong? <br>

have to be famous last words....)

GARAK: You live here? <br>
BASHIR: That's right. <br>
GARAK: Decorate it yourself? <br>
BASHIR: The decor is appropriate for the period. Nineteen sixty-four. <br>
GARAK: How did you pronounce the name of this city? <br>
BASHIR: Kowloon it's part of Hong Kong. <br>
GARAK: And the nightclub was in Paris, which, if I remember correctly,
was on the other side of the planet. <br>
(Enter the obligatory Bond Girl with the deeply suggestive name, deep
cleavage and mini miniskirt.) <br>
LUVSITT: Mister Bashir, I didn't expect you home so soon. <br>
BASHIR: I decided to leave Paris a little early. Allow me to introduce
my friend, Mister Garak. Garak, this is my personal valet, Mona
Luvsitt. <br>
LUVSITT: Pleased to make your acquaintance. Would you like to change
into something more comfortable? <br>
BASHIR: That would be perfect. See if we can find Mister Garak
something as well. <br>
LUVSITT: I'll see what I can do. Would you like me to put this away? (a
briefcase) <br>
BASHIR: Please. Care for a drink? <br>
GARAK: Not just yet. <br>
(Mona goes to a big mirror and presses a button. It rotates to reveal
an arsenal of weapons.) <br>
GARAK: Is she your valet or your personal assassin? <br>
BASHIR: Valet. Mona is very capable. She speaks seven languages, has
degrees in biology, chemistry, physics, can fly anything from a jet to
a helicopter and makes an excellent martini. <br>
MONA: Is there anything else I can do for you? <br>
BASHIR: I'll let you know. <br>
GARAK: I take it your character is some kind of rich dilettante with a
fascination for women and weapons. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, my character is far more disreputable. I'm a spy. <br>
GARAK: A spy? And you live here? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. I work for one of the nation states of this era, Great
Britain, which is battling various other nations in what is called the
Cold War. This apartment, my clothes, weapons, even my valet were
provided to me by my government. <br>
GARAK: I think I joined the wrong intelligence service. </font></p>

O'BRIEN: Captain, there's some kind of power surge in the warp core. <br>
SISKO: Looks like a fluctuation in the plasma coils. We'd better take
the warp core offline. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't. There's something wrong with the command control
systems. I'm completely locked out. <br>
WORF: Magnetic interlocks are failing. Warp core breach is imminent. <br>

goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off.
Eddington goes down into the pit.) <br>
ODO: What happened? <br>
EDDINGTON: Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam
them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam
and blew up the primary energising coils. <br>
ODO: Do we still have their patterns? <br>
EDDINGTON: Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to
degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns
somewhere. <br>
ODO: This is more complicated than just an ordinary transporter
pattern. We're going to have to preserve all the neural signatures of
everyone on that runabout. Do you know how much memory it would take to
save just one person's neural signature, much less five? <br>
EDDINGTON: I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store
all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save
it? <br>
COMPUTER: There is insufficient computer memory to save the data. <br>
ODO: The pattern buffer's beginning to lose coherence. The patterns
will start to degrade any second now. <br>
EDDINGTON: Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every
system on the station and then stored the patterns? <br>
COMPUTER: That procedure has not been tested. It cannot be predicted. <br>
ODO: The buffer is depolarising. <br>
EDDINGTON: Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all
computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the
buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. <br>
COMPUTER: Executing command override. <br>
(The lights go out. Monitors display streams of numbers.) <br>

the computer save them in time? <br>

BASHIR: Very funny. Who else did you invite along with you today? <br>
GARAK: This wasn't my idea. Major? <br>
KIRA: Colonel, actually. Colonel Anastasia Komananov, KGB. Oh, Julian,
I never thought I'd see you alive again. Not after you fell out of that
dirigible over Iceland. <br>
BASHIR: I had a parachute, and there was a submarine there waiting for
me. But how do you know about that? Have you been downloading my
holosuite programmes? <br>
KIRA: Oh Julian, you are not well. Let's lie down. <br>
GARAK: I must say, Major Kira's certainly throwing herself into the

BASHIR: Nerys, please. <br>
KIRA: Who is this Major Nerys Kira? <br>
BASHIR: Kira Nerys, actually. <br>

(She hands him a manila file) <br>
KIRA: In the last twenty-four hours, a series of earthquakes have
struck cities from Vladivostok to New York. Our seismologists have
analysed the earthquakes and come to the conclusion that they are
artificial. <br>

government and yours have decided to cooperate. We will be working very
closely. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure we will. <br>
KIRA: Our assignment is to find out who caused the earthquakes and what
they want. <br>
GARAK: A rather vague assignment. <br>
KIRA: We do have one clue. One of the world's leading seismologists,
Professor Honey Bare, has vanished. We believe she has been kidnapped. <br>
(Bashir stares at the photograph.) <br>
KIRA: I didn't think she was your type. <br>
BASHIR: You said she's been kidnapped. <br>
KIRA: We think so. She disappeared only a few hours before the first
quake struck New York City. <br>
GARAK: Doctor, we're in the middle of an emergency. Is this really the
time to be playing games? <br>

BASHIR: Look. <br>
GARAK: Interesting. <br>
(The photo is Dax in lab coat, classes and bun.) <br>
BASHIR: If Honey Bare is killed, the computer will erase her character
from its programme. Now since the programme thinks that Dax is Honey
Bare <br>
GARAK: The computer would actually be erasing Commander Dax's pattern. <br>

unfinished business. <br>

O'BRIEN: Surprised to see me, Mister Bashir? <br>
BASHIR: You could say that. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, you should use something a little more lethal than a
champagne cork. Something like this. <br>
KIRA: Wait! Wait, please. Let us have one last kiss. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why not? I've always been a romantic at heart. <br>

earring.) <br>

one thug and Garak the other as Kira kicks Falcon out cold. ) <br>

KIRA: Niet! What are you doing? <br>
BASHIR: We can't kill him. <br>
KIRA: Julian, what are you saying? He's been trying to kill you for
nine years. <br>
GARAK: I wouldn't dismiss her idea so quickly, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: But that's Miles. <br>
GARAK: No. As you pointed out, he's Falcon, a hired assassin who's
going to do everything he can to kill you. And without the holosuite
safeties in place, he may do just that. <br>
BASHIR: What do you want me to do? Kill him? <br>
GARAK: I want you to stop treating this like a game where everything's
going to turn out all right in the end. Real spies have to make hard
choices. You want to save Dax? Fine. But you may not have the luxury of
saving everyone. <br>
KIRA: Who is Dax? <br>
GARAK: Eventually you may have to let someone die. <br>
BASHIR: I'll deal with that situation if and when it happens. In the
meantime, we have to find Dax. <br>
KIRA: Who is Dax? <br>
BASHIR: Ana, I promise I'll explain everything later. Now, you said
Professor Bare had been kidnapped. Do you have any suspects? <br>
KIRA: We believe that Doctor Noah is behind the abductions. During the
past two years, he has kidnapped an elite group of sixty artisans and
scientists from around the world. No one knows why or where he has
taken them, but our sources tell us that each of the missing people was
invited to meet Doctor Noah at a club in Paris shortly before they
disappeared. <br>
BASHIR: The Club IngÃ©nue? <br>
KIRA: Da. <br>
BASHIR: I had a feeling. (goes to Mona's body) Sorry, my dear. I hope
you remember how to tie a bow-tie. We're going to Paris. <br>

EDDINGTON: I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in

EDDINGTON: The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly
complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical
patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not
reading any neural energy. <br>
ROM: Neural energy has to be stored at the quantum level. The holosuite
can't handle that. <br>
ODO: So if their physical bodies are stored here, where are their brain
patterns? <br>
QUARK: Everywhere else. Their brain patterns are so large that they're
taking up every bit of computer memory on the station. Replicator
memory, weapons, life supports. <br>
ODO: He may be right. So what do we do about it? How do we get them
back?

BASHIR: I don't have one. <br>
WORF: The Doctor does not like unexpected guests. <br>
KIRA: I believe Doctor Noah would be very interested in meeting my
husband. He's one of the leading geologists in the world. <br>
WORF: Now why would that interest Doctor Noah? <br>
GARAK: We believe he's taken quite an interest in the sciences. After
all, he has invited several of the world's top scientists to this club.
Isn't that true? <br>
BASHIR: I must say I feel a little insulted by being left out of such
an illustrious group. <br>
WORF: How unfortunate. Of course, a meeting still can be arranged. For
a price. <br>
BASHIR: Oh? <br>
WORF: Five million francs. <br>
BASHIR: No problem. <br>
(Bashir puts a note on the table.) <br>
WORF: I do not understand. Where's the rest of your money? <br>

themselves The True Way has claimed responsibility for sabotaging the
runabout. <br>
EDDINGTON: Ever heard of them before? <br>
ODO: They're opposed to the peace treaty, they blame the Federation for
Cardassia's economic and political troubles, et cetera, et cetera.
Until now, they've never committed any terrorist action to support
their beliefs. What have you found? <br>
EDDINGTON: From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has
stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout
throughout the entire station. <br>
QUARK: Don't everyone thank me at once. <br>
ROM: What we need to do is re-integrate their neural patterns with
their physical patterns from the holosuite and rematerialise them. <br>
EDDINGTON: I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers
are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. <br>
ROM: Sounds good. Except <br>
EDDINGTON: Except what? <br>
ROM: Well, my equipment isn't designed to interface with Starfleet
systems. I may have to make some modifications.

KIRA: что случилось? (Shto chort sloo-chee-luhs?) <br>
GARAK: Another decorator's nightmare. This era has a distinct lack of
taste. <br>
BASHIR: Where are we? <br>
SISKO: Welcome to Paradise, Mister Merriweather. I believe you've been
looking for me. My name is Hippocrates Noah. <br>
(After the break, handing round cigars - Kira takes one) <br>
SISKO: Mister Merriweather, I understand your field is geology. <br>
BASHIR: That's right. <br>
SISKO: Then I'm sure you can appreciate these stones in my most recent
acquisition. <br>
(The vase on the table.) <br>
BASHIR: A most striking display of rubies, tourmaline, sapphire, topaz.
Judging by the high chromium content in the rubies, I'd say they come
from the hydrothermal deposits on the Tibetan plateau. Which isn't
surprising, considering we're on the south eastern slope of Mount
Everest at about twenty two thousand feet, I should say. <br>
SISKO: Twenty five actually. <br>
BASHIR: You must not get many tourists. <br>
SISKO: My guests and I place a premium on our privacy. We don't want
any unwelcomed guests, such as men sent by governments who disagree
with my political philosophy. <br>
KIRA: And what is your philosophy? Are you some kind of anarchist? <br>
SISKO: Quite the opposite. I believe in an orderly world. A far cry
from the chaos we find ourselves in today. We are building a new future
here. A new beginning for mankind. A new chapter in human history will
open right here on my island. <br>
BASHIR: Island? <br>
SISKO: Forgive me. Sometimes I do get ahead of myself. Allow me to
explain. <br>
(Sisko pushes a button and the oak-panelled wall raises to reveal a
control centre with an illuminated world map on the wall.) <br>
DAX: We're almost ready. I've programmed the laser sequence and I'm
making some last minute adjustments to a South American Site. <br>
SISKO: I do have every confidence in you, my dear. <br>
KIRA: She's working with him. <br>
SISKO: You see, Mister Merriweather, I intend not only to create a new
future, I intend to create a new world. At each one of these points, I
have hidden a new form of laser. One that can penetrate the Earth's
crust down into the mantle itself. <br>
BASHIR: The global earthquakes. <br>
SISKO: Those were only tests. Soon I will activate all of these lasers
together, and when I do, they will produce worldwide earthquakes the
likes of which we have never been felt before. <br>
GARAK: Killing everyone on the planet. <br>
SISKO: More than that. There comes a time when a house has been so
damaged by termites that you must not only kill the termites but
demolish the house and build again. The quakes are only a minor side
effect. The real goal of this project is to have these lasers of mine
produce massive fissures in the Earth's crust, releasing millions of
tons of molten lava. Now, Mister Merriweather, you're the geologist.
Tell me what happens next. <br>
BASHIR: Once that much lava is released, the tectonic plates would
begin to settle. <br>
SISKO: And the surface of the planet will shrink, just like letting air
out of a balloon. <br>
KIRA: But if the surface of the Earth shrinks, the oceans <br>
BASHIR: Will cover the Earth. Diabolical. <br>
SISKO: Visionary. I am going to let mankind begin anew, here on this
island paradise, the only place that will remain above water on my
brave new world. And that is why I have gathered the finest minds, the
very best that mankind has to offer. We will repopulate and start a new
human race. Pity you won't be able to join us. <br>
BASHIR: Are you revoking my invitation? <br>
SISKO: I intend to do more than that, Mister Bashir. Not only have I
brought the greatest minds to my mountain retreat, but I have also
hired the greatest protection that money can buy. I believe you already
know my newest employee. <br>

that even I can't stop. Once the laser fires, the whole cave will be
filled with molten lava. <br>
BASHIR: Where's Colonel Komananov? <br>
SISKO: She's a spirited individual. Young, healthy. We'll need women
like her to help propagate the second human race. <br>
(He switches on the laser and the countdown starts - 4:59 4:58 4:57) <br>
SISKO: Try to stay cool, Mister Bashir. <br>
(Sisko and O'Brien leave. We skip a couple of minutes. 3:44 3:43) <br>
GARAK: So what do we do now? <br>
BASHIR: I'm thinking. <br>
GARAK: Think faster. I don't know if I've made this explicit to you or
not, Doctor, but I really don't want to die chained to a twentieth
century laser. I think it's time to end this programme. <br>
BASHIR: We can't do that. We'd wipe out the patterns of Sisko and the
others. <br>
GARAK: Then may I suggest calling Commander Eddington and having him
send someone in here to remove these handcuffs? <br>
BASHIR: You heard what Odo said. We don't know what'll happen if we
interrupt the holo-imaging array by calling for the doors. The entire
programme might collapse and kill them all. <br>
GARAK: Well I only know one thing for sure, Doctor, that when the
molten lava begins pouring into this cave, you and I are going to be
very uncomfortable. <br>

are. <br>
GARAK: Is that your plan? <br>
BASHIR: Shut up. Noah only wants you for your mind. He can't appreciate
the woman inside you. Honey, would you grant me one last request and
take off those glasses? <br>
(Garak groans and rolls his eyes.) <br>
DAX: Like this? <br>
BASHIR: You know, your hair would look so much better if it were free. <br>

about your fantasy life. <br>

BASHIR: There. That's the last thing I want to remember before I die. <br>

has given me all we need. <br>

ammunition.) <br>
BASHIR: If this programme ends like the others, either Komananov or
Honey Bare will be killed by Doctor Noah. The other's supposed to end
up with me. In either case, we have to make sure that both of them
survive. <br>
GARAK: You expect to take on Noah and his men with that? <br>
BASHIR: It's my fantasy. Trust me. <br>
GARAK: No! This has gone far enough. It's time to cut our losses. <br>
BASHIR: We can't do that. Kira or Dax might <br>
GARAK: Yes, they might be killed, and that is unfortunate. But there
comes a point when the odds are against you and the only reasonable
course of action is to quit! <br>
BASHIR: Quit? <br>
GARAK Yes. <br>
BASHIR: Is that what they taught you in the Obsidian Order? To give up
when things get tough? <br>
GARAK: As a matter of fact, they did. That's why I've managed to stay
alive while most of my colleagues are dead. Because I know when to walk
away. And that time is now. And you'd know that, Doctor, if you were a
real intelligence agent. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, so that's what this is all about. The fact that my fantasy
happens to step on what you consider to be your private domain. Well
what's the matter, Garak? Have I bruised your ego by play-acting at
something you take so very seriously? <br>
GARAK: That's something else you've yet to learn, Doctor. A real
intelligence agent has no ego, no conscience, no remorse. Only a sense
of professionalism. And mine is telling me that it's time to go.
Computer! <br>
BASHIR: Don't. <br>
GARAK: Or what? You'll kill me? <br>
BASHIR: If you call for the exit, you might kill Sisko and the others,
and I'm not prepared to risk that. <br>
GARAK: I'm afraid I don't believe you'll pull that trigger. <br>
BASHIR: I wouldn't be so sure about that. <br>
GARAK: It's time to face reality, Doctor. You're a man who dreams of
being a hero because you know, deep down, that you're not. I'm no hero
either, but I do know how to make a choice, and I'm choosing to save
myself. Computer, show me the mechanism <br>
(BANG! The bullet grazes Garak's neck) <br>
BASHIR: You'll be fine. It's just a flesh wound. <br>
GARAK: That was awfully close. What if you'd killed me? <br>
BASHIR: What makes you think I wasn't trying? <br>
GARAK: Doctor, I do believe there's hope for you yet. <br>
BASHIR: I'm so relieved. Now, we have to get to the control room. Are
you coming or not? <br>

it wouldn't be very heroic. I, on the other hand, have no pretensions

more I think about it, the more I realise that your way may be the only
way. <br>

destroy this world and start a new one. What's the use of me continuing
to defend a doomed planet? Can you see the sense in that? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
BASHIR: No. I'm an intelligence agent, and if there's any one thing
I've learnt, it is that there comes a point when the odds are against
you and there is no reasonable course of action but to quit. How do you
think I've managed to stay alive so long when all of my compatriots are
dead? It is because I have known when to walk away. </font></p>
