Captain's log, stardate 51408.6. I've been aboard the Honshu for two
days now and I still haven't spoken to him, although the doctors have
assured me that he's made a full recovery. Maybe that's what I'm afraid
of. Maybe I prefer to think of him as a crazy man, a broken man. He'd
be less dangerous that way. As terrible as it sounds, there's a part of
me that wishes he were dead. But that's a thought unworthy of a
Starfleet officer. He lost an empire, he lost his daughter, and he
nearly lost his mind. Whatever his crimes isn't that enough punishment
for one lifetime?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko enters and the security guard leaves. Dukat
is kneeling in his cell, apparently meditating or praying.) <br>
DUKAT: I heard you were aboard. (he looks up) I was wondering if you'd
make an appearance. <br>
SISKO: How are you? <br>
DUKAT: Better. The doctors tell me I've made a remarkable recovery. <br>
SISKO: They told me the same thing. <br>
DUKAT: Good. I'd hate to think they were patronising me. So I'm a war
criminal. <br>
SISKO: In the Federation, you're innocent till proven guilty. <br>
DUKAT: So I'm told. Do you believe I'm guilty, Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: I haven't seen all the charges. <br>
DUKAT: It's not like you to equivocate. <br>
SISKO: I'm trying to be fair. You won't be tried until the war is over.
Your appearance before the special jury is just a formality. <br>
DUKAT: And you'll be testifying for the prosecution. <br>
SISKO: I will tell them what I know. <br>
DUKAT: Care to elaborate? <br>
SISKO: Not really. <br>
DUKAT: I see. <br>
SISKO: I never got a chance to tell you how sorry I am about Ziyal. <br>
DUKAT: Do I detect the fine hand of Doctor Cox at work once again? <br>
SISKO: I told him I wanted to offer my condolences. <br>
DUKAT: I'm sorry. The good doctor encourages me to talk about Ziyal
whenever possible, since it was her (big pause) death that brought on
my momentary instability. I shouldn't be so suspicious. <br>
SISKO: It's all right. Well, we should be arriving at Starbase six two
one by noon tomorrow. I'll see you at the arraignment. <br>
DUKAT: Benjamin. About my daughter. You and Major Kira took care of her
for almost a year. I wanted to thank you for that. It was very
generous. <br>
SISKO: Ziyal was a very special young woman. It was a pleasure to have
her with us, even if it was only a short time. <br>
DUKAT: A short time is all she ever had. <br>
SISKO: Is there anything I can get for you? <br>
DUKAT: A bottle of kanar and an Orion slave girl would be nice. <br>
SISKO: I'll see what I can do. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kira and Odo come out of the Captain's office to
make an announcement.) <br>
KIRA: It's confirmed. USS Honshu was destroyed this morning at ten
thirty hours by an attack wing of Cardassian destroyers. Starfleet has
picked up the distress beacons from three escape pods and one
shuttlecraft, so there are survivors. <br>
ODO: The signals are coming from this area. The last reported position
of the Honshu was here, which means there could be survivors in any of
these adjacent star systems. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's a pretty large area. How many ships are in the search
party? <br>
ODO: Two. The Constellation and the Defiant. <br>
DAX: Two? It could take days. <br>
KIRA: With all the Dominion activity along the border, it's all
Starfleet can spare at the moment. And the Defiant has another
appointment. In fifty two hours you need to be at this rendezvous point
outside the Badlands. You are the escort for a Federation troop convoy.
<br>
WORF: It will take twelve hours just to arrive at the coordinates where
the Honshu was destroyed. <br>
KIRA: And twelve more to reach the Badlands, I know. But this convoy is
completely unprotected. They've been using the plasma fields in the
Badlands to hide their movements, and when they emerge they're helpless
without the Defiant. <br>
BASHIR: Can't they delay the convoy? I mean, if Captain Sisko is still
alive, we have to give him every chance to <br>
KIRA: I raised the same objection myself and the orders still stand.
Now, every minute spent arguing here is one less minute spent searching
for the captain. <br>
WORF: Prepare for immediate departure. <br>
KIRA: Worf, there are over thirty thousand Federation troops in that
convoy. You have fifty two hours, not one second longer. Understood? <br>
WORF: Understood. Defiant.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There's a camp fire. Dukat hypo's Sisko awake.) <br>
DUKAT: Benjamin, can you hear me? <br>
SISKO: Dukat? <br>
DUKAT: Yes. Everything's all right, but don't try to move too quickly.
The left side of your body is covered with plasma burns. <br>
(Sisko's left arm is in a metallic splint.) <br>
SISKO: We were in the brig and the ship went to Red Alert. <br>
DUKAT: We were attacked by a wing of Cardassian ships, ironically. <br>
SISKO: I was heading to Engineering. <br>
DUKAT: You didn't get very far. A plasma conduit exploded before you
got fifteen metres down the corridor. That's where Lieutenant McConnell
and I found you when the order came to abandon ship. <br>
SISKO: Where's McConnell? <br>
DUKAT: Dead. A piece of shrapnel hit him in the head just as we were
carrying you into the shuttle. <br>
SISKO: Any other survivors? <br>
DUKAT: I saw a few escape pods leaving the ship just before it
exploded, but I had my hands full just trying to keep us in one piece.
The engines were damaged from the shockwaves and I set us down here,
wherever here is. But that shuttle's never going to reach orbit again.
The shuttle's distress beacon was damaged, but I think I managed to
repair it. <br>
(Lights are blinking and the small screen says System On-Line.) <br>
DUKAT: So now we have to do is wait for someone to pick up our signal. <br>
SISKO: Whose signal are you transmitting? Starfleet or the Dominion? <br>
DUKAT: It's a general distress call, Benjamin. Whoever gets here first
will find one comrade in arms and one prisoner. That's fair, isn't it? <br>
SISKO: Fair enough. Did you do this? <br>
DUKAT: You shattered most of the bones in your arm. There was a bone
regenerator in the medkit, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a doctor, so
I just put on the cast. <br>
SISKO: You did plenty. Thank you. <br>
DUKAT: We have enough field rations to last us a few weeks, but I'd
feel better if I could locate another source of food and water. The
surface is inhospitable to say the least, but I did manage to find some
firewood and kindling, so there's a good chance there's edible
vegetation out there. I just have to find it. <br>
SISKO: You could have left me behind. Why didn't you? <br>
DUKAT: I didn't want to. I'll be back within the hour.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEYOUN: What are you planning to do with him? <br>
DUKAT: The Captain and I have a lot to talk about. <br>
WEYOUN: Such as? <br>
DUKAT: It's of a personal nature. <br>
WEYOUN: I see. You're going to share your feelings of loneliness and
sorrow with your longtime adversary. Doctor Cox'd be so proud. <br>
DUKAT: Go away. <br>
WEYOUN: You should kill him now, while you still can. <br>
DUKAT: That won't be necessary. He's in no condition to challenge me. I
can afford to be patient. <br>
WEYOUN: You should kill him. <br>
DUKAT: I don't care for your tone. <br>
WEYOUN: Spare me your endless posturing. You're lucky I speak to you at
all after that pathetic display back at the hospital. <br>
DUKAT: That's enough. <br>
WEYOUN: Oh, I see. It's a sensitive topic. I wonder what Captain Sisko
would think if he'd seen you curled up in a ball, crying yourself to
sleep every night? <br>
DUKAT: Stop it! <br>
WEYOUN: I doubt held still have the same respect for you if he'd heard
you screaming and screaming and screaming like a madman till the nurses
came and the doctors had to sedate you! <br>
DUKAT: No! <br>
(Dukat shoots at Weyoun but only blows a hole in the rock wall.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dukat samples some liquid from a pan over a
camping stove, and spits it out.) <br>
SISKO: Is that breakfast? <br>
DUKAT: Possibly. Good morning. <br>
SISKO: Morning. What's it like outside? <br>
DUKAT: The wind has died down and the temperature's gone up twenty
degrees. I rather like it, but I think you'll be more comfortable in
here where it's cooler. <br>
(Dukat shreds some leaves into the liquid.) <br>
SISKO: Too much. <br>
DUKAT: I'm doing the cooking here, thank you. <br>
SISKO: Pardon me. <br>
DUKAT: You're not the only officer who learned how to cook. How are you
feeling? <br>
SISKO: A little better. <br>
DUKAT: Good. After last night, I was beginning to get worried. <br>
SISKO: Last night? <br>
DUKAT: You don't remember? <br>
SISKO: Now that you mention it I remember waking up and I was feeling a
little dizzy. <br>
DUKAT: You had a bout of nausea. Not exactly a little bout. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I'm sorry. <br>
DUKAT: That's all right. I've had to clean up a lot worse in my time.
Once, when I was a newly minted glinn on the Kornaire, I had to help
clean up a compartment where three men had gone through an explosive
decompression. I didn't sleep for a week after that. <br>
SISKO: Let's change the subject. <br>
DUKAT: The Emissary has spoken. Oh, come on, Benjamin. Have a sense of
humour about all this. <br>
SISKO: I'm not in much of a joking mood. <br>
DUKAT: Well that's a shame, because there's so much to laugh about. You
don't see it, do you? Benjamin, just a few hours ago I was a prisoner
on my way to trial and you were my old friend come to visit me in my
cell. Now look at us. I'm free and you're a prisoner of your own
battered body, and there's a good chance we'll be rescued by the
Dominion. You've got to laugh at a universe that allows such radical
shifts in fortune, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: I will laugh when a Federation starship arrives and puts you
back in a cell. <br>
DUKAT: Whatever you say. <br>
(Dukat starts to hand over a bowl then suddenly looks across the
cavern.) <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
DUKAT: Nothing. it's probably just the wind. <br>
(He gives Sisko a bowl of liquid. Sisko takes a sip.) <br>
DUKAT: How is it? <br>
SISKO: Needs salt. There's probably some in one of the ration packs. <br>
DUKAT: You know, we didn't get much of a chance to catch up before the
attack. How is everyone on what I'm sure you're once again calling Deep
Space Nine? Odo, Kira, Quark? <br>
SISKO: They're all fine. And no, they don't miss you. <br>
DUKAT: Perhaps not. They never really did give me much of a chance.
They were too busy plotting my downfall. <br>
SISKO: Pepper. If you only want me to tell you what you want to hear,
just say so. <br>
DUKAT: Well I hope they at least told you that my policies toward the
Bajorans were most generous this time. <br>
SISKO: They told me Weyoun didn't give you much of a choice. <br>
DUKAT: Major Kira knows full well I made every effort to heal the
wounds between Cardassia and Bajor. Since the very beginning it was my
intention to rectify the mistakes of the past and begin a new chapter
in our relations. <br>
SISKO: Are you going to put that in my soup? <br>
DUKAT: Well? <br>
SISKO: Better. <br>
DUKAT: You're not going to give me the benefit of the doubt, are you,
Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: Do you really care what I think? <br>
DUKAT: Don't you care what your old friends think of you? <br>
SISKO: Dukat, we're not old friends. You saved my life and I'm
grateful, but that's as far as it goes. <br>
(Dukat suddenly looks across the cavern again.) <br>
SISKO: You keep hearing something. Are you sure there's nothing out
there? <br>
DUKAT: It's just the wind, I'm certain, but I'm going to double check
just to make sure. </font></p>

DAMAR: You're wasting time. <br>
DUKAT: It's my time to waste, Damar. Remember your place. <br>
DAMAR: I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war
will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man
stand in the way of your final triumph. <br>
DUKAT: I have to know that he respects me. I think I've earned it. <br>
DAMAR: Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the
satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly
admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it.

now. But I see no reason why we shouldn't be comfortable in the
meantime. How's that? <br>
SISKO: Just fine, thank you. <br>
DUKAT: Good. (sits on the other one) Ah, much better. You know, when I
was out there in the shuttle just now, it occurred to me that the
Bajorans would be very confused if they could see us here, sharing the
same food, the same hardships. What do you think they would say if they
knew the Emissary of the Prophets and the evil Gul Dukat were sitting
here together, getting along like the two old friends that they really
are? Oh, I forgot. You don't think of me as your old friend, do you,
Benjamin. It's all right. There's no one here. Just the two of us. No
one to impress, no one to judge what you say. We can be honest with one
another. So tell me. What you really think of me? <br>
KIRA: I'll tell you what I think. You're an evil, sadistic man who
should've been tried as a war criminal years ago, put up against a wall
and shot. <br>
DUKAT: You probably agree with Major Kira, don't you, Benjamin? I am
the former Prefect of Bajor. An evil man who sent thousands of Bajorans
to their deaths to satisfy his own sadistic desires. <br>
KIRA: Of course he agrees with me. And it was millions. <br>
SISKO: I don't think there's any point in discussing this. <br>
DUKAT: I do. My name and reputation have been slandered and twisted
ever since the end of the occupation of Bajor. I have been vilified by
ignorant, small minded people throughout the quadrant for the past six
years. I just want to know if you're one of them, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: I wasn't there during the occupation. I didn't see all the
things you had to struggle with day after day. I don't think I can pass
judgement. <br>
KIRA: He's just doesn't want to anger you. He really thinks you're a
vicious, cold blooded killer, Dukat, and so do I. <br>
DUKAT: I don't care what you think so I suggest you keep your opinions
to yourself. (to Sisko) I don't think you're being entirely honest with
me, Benjamin. You're not a man who hesitates to make snap judgements
when the situation calls for it. It's one of the signs of a good
commander. Now I'm asking for your opinion of me and I find it hard to
believe you don't have one. <br>
SISKO: All right. I think you're right. You have been judged unfairly.
I've judged you unfairly. But I think you probably had good reasons for
everything you did on Bajor. <br>
DUKAT: Yes. Yes, that's it exactly. I had good reasons. Some of the
harsher actions I took were forced on me by Central Command. I wanted
to use entirely different tactics with the Bajorans. I wanted to rule
with a softer hand, but my superiors didn't see it that way. <br>
SISKO: You were a soldier and you had to carry out your orders. <br>
DUKAT: Precisely. <br>
(Kira nearly falls over in hysterical laughter.) <br>
KIRA: You are such a fool. <br>
DUKAT: Leave us alone! This doesn't concern you! <br>
KIRA: He's patronising you. You were a soldier and you had to carry out
your orders. He doesn't believe that lame excuse any more than I do. <br>
DUKAT: This is growing tiresome. <br>
SISKO: Dukat. Dukat! I thought you wanted to talk to me. <br>
DUKAT: Yes, but Nerys won't leave well enough alone. She's always
interfering, always trying to upset me. <br>

not even here.

WORF: Our rescue effort has been delayed. If we could just have a few
more hours? <br>
(It's a bad connection to DS9.) <br>
KIRA: The troop convoy will be completely unprotected when they emerge
from the plasma fields. They're under strict radio silence. No way they
can acknowledge our signal even if. Sorry, Worf, but you're going to
have to <br>
(Transmission drops out.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry, Captain. There's some kind of subspace interference
between us and the station. I'll keep trying. <br>
BASHIR: I couldn't understand a word Kira said. Too much interference.
Looks to me like we're on our own. <br>
DAX: I could understood what she was trying to say. <br>
BASHIR: What about you, Chief? Did you understand? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, I couldn't understand a word. <br>
DAX: Well it doesn't really matter what we think. Commander Worf is
captain here. <br>
WORF: We all know what Major Kira's orders were. It would be
dishonourable to ignore them. <br>
BASHIR: You will forgive me if I don't consider your honour to be worth
Captain Sisko's life. <br>
WORF: You may leave the bridge, Doctor. <br>
(Bashir leaves.) <br>
WORF: Helm, lay in a course for the third planet. <br>
DAX: Aye, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko has been beaten up. Dukat is cleaning blood
from the metal pipe.) <br>
DUKAT: You brought it on yourself, you know. <br>
SISKO: Just like all your victims. <br>
DUKAT: All my victims. It always comes back to that, doesn't it? All my
crimes. I'm such a monster, such an evil man. Behold Benjamin Sisko,
supreme arbiter of right and wrong in the universe. A man of such high
moral calibre that he can sit in judgement on all the rest of us. <br>
SISKO: What the hell do you want from me? My approval? Is that what
this is all about? You want me to give you my permission to cause more
suffering and death? Well, if that's what you're after, you might as
well pull out that phaser and end this right now because I will never
give it to you! <br>
DUKAT: Good! Good, I like this. No more pretence, no games. Just you,
me and the truth. <br>
SISKO: What do you know about the truth? You bend the truth into
whatever shape suits you. <br>
DUKAT: Judge Sisko hands down another ruling. But where's his evidence?
<br>
SISKO: All right. You really want to do this? Here? Now? <br>
DUKAT: Yes. <br>
SISKO: Okay. Okay, let's do it. You were Prefect of Bajor during the
occupation. True or false? <br>
DUKAT: True. <br>
SISKO: And you were responsible for everything that happened under your
command. True or false? <br>
DUKAT: True. <br>
SISKO: So that means that you are responsible for the murder of over
five million Bajorans on your watch. True or false! <br>
DUKAT: False. I tried to save lives during my administration. <br>
SISKO: Evidence? <br>
DUKAT: Evidence? He wants evidence. By the time I became Prefect, the
occupation had been going on for almost forty years, but the planet
still wasn't ready for full scale colonisation. Central Command wanted
the situation resolved and they didn't care how it was done. I was
convinced that a gentler hand was required to deal with the Bajorans. <br>
DAMAR: It was a noble, if misguided, vision. <br>
DUKAT: So in my first official act as Prefect, I ordered all labour
camp commanders to reduce their output quotas by fifty percent fifty
percent. Then I reorganised the camps themselves. Child labour was
abolished. Medical care was improved. Food rations were increased. At
the end of one month of my administration, the death rate had dropped
by twenty percent. Now how did the Bajorans react to all this? On my
one month anniversary they blew up an orbital dry-dock, killing over
two hundred Cardassian soldiers and workers. <br>
KIRA: We didn't want a reconciliation. We wanted to destroy you. <br>
DUKAT: So I had to order a response. But even then it was a carefully
tempered one. I ordered two hundred suspected members of the Resistance
rounded up and executed. Two hundred lives for two hundred lives.
That's justice, not malevolence. Justice. <br>
WEYOUN: The Dominion would never have been so generous. <br>
DUKAT: But did I give up my efforts to reach out to the Bajorans? No. I
tried again. And what did I get for my troubles? An assassination
attempt on my own space station! Another round of executions followed
once again, courtesy of the Bajoran resistance. <br>
KIRA: We never wanted peace. We hated you. We hated all of you. <br>
DUKAT: On and on it went, year after blood-soaked year. Time and again
I would reach out with the open hand of friendship, and time and again
they would slap it away. <br>
DAMAR: The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. <br>
KIRA: Being reasonable only made us bolder. <br>
WEYOUN: The Dominion would have killed every man, woman and child on
Bajor long ago. <br>
DUKAT: I hope you're listening to all this. <br>
SISKO: Oh believe me, you have my undivided attention. Now let me get
this straight. You're not responsible for what happened during the
occupation, the Bajorans are. <br>
DUKAT: Yes, yes, exactly. <br>
SISKO: So, why do you think they didn't appreciate this rare
opportunity you were offering them? <br>
DUKAT: Because they were blind, ignorant fools. If only they had
cooperated with us, we could have turned their world into a paradise.
From the moment we arrived on Bajor, it was clear that we were the
superior race. But they couldn't accept that. They wanted to be treated
as equals when they most certainly were not. Militarily,
technologically, culturally, we were almost a century ahead of them in
every way. We did not choose to be the superior race. Fate handed us
our role. And it would've been so much easier on everyone if the
Bajorans had simply accepted their role. But no, day after day they
clustered in their temples and prayed for deliverance, and night after
night they planted bombs outside of our homes. Pride. Stubborn,
unyielding pride. From the servant girl that cleaned my quarters to the
condemned man toiling in a labour camp to the terrorist skulking
through the hills of Dahkur Province. They all wore their pride like
some twisted badge of honour. <br>
SISKO: And you hated them for it. <br>
DUKAT: Of course I hated them! I hated everything about them! Their
superstitions and their cries for sympathy, their treachery and their
lies, their smug superiority and their stiff necked obstinacy, their
earrings and their broken wrinkled noses. <br>
SISKO: You should have killed them all. <br>
DUKAT: Yes! Yes! That's right, isn't it? (his companions nod) I knew
it! I've always known it! I should have killed every last one of them.
I should have turned their planet into a graveyard the likes of which
the galaxy had never seen! I should have killed them all. <br>
(A metal bar crashes down on his head, and Dukat falls.) <br>
SISKO: And that is why you're not an evil man. </font></p>

Benjamin, because we won't be seeing each other for a while. I have
unfinished business on Bajor. They thought I was their enemy? They
don't know what it is to be my enemy, but they will. From this day
forward, Bajor is dead. All of Bajor. And this time, even their
Emissary won't be able to save them. <br>

SISKO: No, they won't. You know, old man, sometimes life seems so
complicated. Nothing is truly good or truly evil. Everything seems to
be a shade of grey. And then you spend some time with a man like Dukat
and you realise that there is really such a thing as truly evil. <br>
DAX: To realise that is one thing. To do something about it is another.
So what are you going to do? <br>
SISKO: I'll tell you what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to let him
destroy Bajor. I fear no evil. From now on, it's him or me. </font>
