bed. The bunks on this ship are so uncomfortable. <br>
KIRA: You know what I could use? A weekend at the Golian Spa. <br>
DAX: Maybe you and Shakaar can slip away when we get back. <br>
KIRA: We're not seeing each other anymore. <br>
ODO: When did this happen? <br>
KIRA: Last week. <br>
DAX: No wonder you've been so down lately. <br>
KIRA: I miss him. But last time we were on Bajor, we went to the Kenda
Shrine and we asked the Prophets if we were meant to walk the same
path. <br>
DAX: And? <br>
KIRA: We're not. <br>
DAX: You make it sound so cut and dry. <br>
KIRA: The way I see it, people are either meant to be together or
they're not. <br>
DAX: I guess I'd rather believe that any relationship can work as long
as both people really want it to. <br>
ODO: I'm not sure I have an opinion on the subject. Excuse me. I need
to regenerate. <br>
(Odo leaves.) <br>
KIRA: Is he all right? <br>
DAX: You know Odo. This sort of talk makes him uncomfortable.

SISKO: No, thanks. I'm trying to cut down. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm making Molly a dollhouse for her birthday. Thank you. The
house itself was easy, but the furniture? Even with a microlathe, I'm
not sure I'm going to get it all finished in time. <br>
KIRA: I guess her dolls are going to have to rough it for a while. <br>
DAX: Interesting. I'm getting some unusual readings from a nearby solar
system. <br>
WORF: What kind of readings? <br>
DAX: There's some sort of energy barrier surrounding the fourth planet.
<br>
KIRA: It's hard to tell from the interference, but there could be
lifeforms on the surface. <br>
DAX: If there are, I'd be interested to see how they've adapted to the
quantum fluctuations in the barrier. <br>
O'BRIEN: Can't we check it out the next time we come this way? <br>
DAX: It'll be too late. At the rate the interference is intensifying,
in few weeks we won't even be able to send a probe through it. <br>
SISKO: Dax. <br>
DAX: I know everyone wants to go home, but if we're going to take a
look at this planet, it'll be our only chance. <br>
SISKO: Are you sure it's safe to pass through the interference? <br>
DAX: A few shield modifications and it should be smooth sailing. <br>
SISKO: All right, we'll make a quick survey. But if all we detect is
some fungus, we're not beaming down. <br>
DAX: What if it's smart fungus? <br>
(At the planet.) <br>
KIRA: We're approaching the barrier. <br>
SISKO: All right, old man, take us in. <br>
(It's bumpy.) <br>
DAX: Adjusting shield harmonics to compensate. <br>
O'BRIEN: Quantum fluctuations are intensifying. <br>
(Bang! Red Alert. Energy runs over all the consoles and enters Kira.
For a moment there are two of her.) <br>
DAX: We're through. <br>
SISKO: Are you all right? <br>
KIRA: I think so. <br>
SISKO: Doctor Bashir to the Bridge. <br>
KIRA: Oh, no, I'm fine. <br>
O'BRIEN: The inertial dampers are offline, and the gyromagnetic
stabilisers are depolarised. We're going to be here for a few days. <br>
SISKO: Smooth sailing. <br>
WORF: Sir, we are being hailed from the surface. There are several
scattered settlements across the southern peninsula. I am reading
approximately eight thousand inhabitants. They appear to be human. <br>
SISKO: On screen. <br>
MIRANDA: (a red-headed woman) Welcome to Gaia, Captain Sisko. <br>
SISKO: You know my name. <br>
MIRANDA: We've been expecting you. <br>
YEDRIN: It's a long story, Benjamin. Why don't you come down and we'll
talk about it over some raktajino. Oh, I forgot. You're trying to cut
down.

MIRANDA: Miranda O'Brien. <br>
YEDRIN: Yedrin. Yedrin Dax. <br>
(He is clearly a Trill.) <br>
DAX: What a coincidence. <br>
SISKO: Would one of you mind telling us what's going on? <br>
MIRANDA: This settlement was founded by the crew of a Starfleet vessel
that crashed on this planet two centuries ago. I realise this is going
to be hard for you to accept but that ship was the Defiant. Two days
from now, when you leave here and try to pass through the energy
barrier, you'll be thrown back in time two hundred years. You'll be
stranded here and become the founders of this settlement. We are your
descendents. <br>
(After the opening credits.) <br>
YEDRIN: Go ahead, Jadzia, scan me. You'll find the Dax symbiont right
here. <br>
DAX: It's true. <br>
YEDRIN: The symbiont has been passed down to Jadzia's descendents for
three generations. I remember all of you like it was yesterday. If you
scan Miranda, you'll find that her DNA is substantially similar to that
of the Chief's. <br>
DAX: She's an O'Brien, all right. <br>
MIRANDA: And a Tannenbaum, too. <br>
O'BRIEN: You mean Ensign Tannenbaum? From Engineering? <br>
YEDRIN: You and Rita were married ten years after the Defiant crashed.
You were trapped here, Miles, two hundred years in the past. There was
no going home. There was no chance of ever seeing your family again.
You were the last to give up hope, but eventually you had to make a new
life for yourself here. I know that face, Benjamin. You're still not
convinced that we're telling you the truth. All right. If you want, I
could tell you something that only Curzon would know. Do you remember
that dancer that you met on Pelios station? The one who <br>
SISKO: The one? That'll do. Thank you. <br>
GABRIEL: (a boy) Are you the son of Mogh? <br>
WORF: I am. <br>
GABRIEL: Is it true you can kill someone just by looking at them? <br>
WORF: Only when I am angry. <br>
MIRANDA: Why don't we go inside? You can meet some of the others later.
We still have a lot to talk about.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Meeting hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A ships viewscreen and a fireplace. A virtual
Quark is giving maths lesson 916 on the viewscreen to two young girls.)
<br>
QUARK: Ready for the next problem? Say you have twenty seven tessipates
of land you want to plant with nice juicy yelg melons. <br>
MIRANDA: This is our meeting hall, which as you can see, we sometimes
use as a schoolroom. <br>
QUARK [on viewscreen]: If each melon needs one square kerripate to grow
in, what is the total number of melons you can plant? Let me know as
soon as you have an answer. <br>
YEDRIN: Jadzia designed it as an educational programme. She took
Quark's image from the security logs of the Defiant. I've always
thought that Quark would make a great math teacher. He's so good with
numbers. <br>
DAX: I like your spots. <br>
LISA: (dark skinned) Most people don't have them because our ancestors
were mostly human. My mom says they make me special. <br>
MOLLY: (another red-head) It's just genetics, Lisa. Like Torvin's
ridges. <br>
LISA: You're just jealous, Molly. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly? <br>
YEDRIN: Oh yes. You'll find a lot of them here. The name has been
passed down through the O'Brien line. <br>
MIRANDA: Molly, this is your grandfather's great great great
grandfather. <br>
MOLLY: Hello. <br>
O'BRIEN: Hi. How much were we, were you able to salvage from the
Defiant? <br>
YEDRIN: A portable generator, a replicator, a few phasers, tricorders.
Things of that sort. <br>
WORF: Did anybody ever try to send out a distress signal? <br>
YEDRIN: To who? It was two hundred years ago. The wormhole hadn't even
been discovered yet. There was no way back to the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
LISA: Our ancestors decided to make this their new home. <br>
MOLLY: And they needed a shelter quickly before the winter came. <br>
LISA: This is it. This is the oldest building there is. At first,
everyone had to sleep here. All forty eight of them. <br>
SISKO: Forty eight? <br>
YEDRIN: Um. Kira died a few weeks after the crash. The energy discharge
that struck her on the Bridge damaged her neural pathways. The Defiant
didn't have the medical equipment that Julian needed to treat her. <br>
LISA: You want to see where she was buried? <br>
DAX: Maybe later. <br>
MIRANDA: Girls, why don't you run along and help your parents? It's
almost time for planting and there's a lot of work to be done. <br>
LISA: Bye. <br>
MOLLY: Bye. <br>
(The girls leave.) <br>
SISKO: Obviously we need to get Kira back to the station for treatment
as soon as we can repair the Defiant. <br>
YEDRIN: Of course. <br>
SISKO: I don't quite know how to say this, but now that we know about
the accident that sent the ship back in time, we should be able to
avoid it. <br>
WORF: But if we do that, your timeline will collapse and everything
here will cease to exist. <br>
YEDRIN: Not necessarily. I have a plan, and the key is what happened to
Kira on the Bridge. This energy discharge caused a subspace doubling
effect. For an instant, every molecule in her body had a corresponding
quantum duplicate. There were literally two Kiras. <br>
SISKO: Go on. <br>
(Temporal amplification simulation 73205 on a wall monitor.) <br>
YEDRIN: If we make certain modifications to the Defiant's systems, we
should be able to amplify this doubling effect and create a quantum
duplicate of the entire ship. When you encounter the temporal anomaly,
the duplicate will be thrown back into the past, and the original, you,
will pass through the barrier unaffected. <br>
O'BRIEN: So you're saying we go home, and your timeline is preserved. <br>
YEDRIN: Exactly. <br>
SISKO: What do you think? <br>
DAX: It might work. <br>
YEDRIN: According to the logs I retrieved from the wreckage, the
Defiant encountered the anomaly thirty nine hours after it arrived in
orbit. <br>
WORF: If your plan is to work, we must do the same. <br>
YEDRIN: There are almost eight thousand people living on this planet.
This is the only chance they have. <br>
SISKO: Dax, I want a full evaluation as soon as possible. If the plan
is sound, start making the modifications immediately. <br>
YEDRIN: Thank you, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: Anything for you, old man.

the quantum fluctuations inside the barrier. <br>
(Bashir puts Odo into a stasis container.) <br>
BASHIR: Sweet dreams, Odo. But he'll be as right as rain as soon as we
leave orbit. You, on the other hand, are going to have to undergo a
complete neural pathway induction as soon as we get back to the
station. <br>
KIRA: If you say so. I feel fine. <br>
BASHIR: That's because your neural tissue hasn't begun to deteriorate
yet. But rest assured, you'll be on my operating table eventually. <br>

ODO: I learned to counter the barrier's effects a long time ago. It's
good to see you. <br>
KIRA: You look different. <br>
ODO: I've gotten better at shape-shifting over the years. You're as
beautiful as I remember. You can't know how I've longed to hear your
voice, see your smile. <br>
KIRA: Odo, what's gotten into you? <br>
ODO: There's something I want you to know. Something I've wanted to
tell you for two hundred years. I love you, Nerys. I've always loved
you. <br>
KIRA: What do you mean, you love me? <br>
ODO: Is it so hard to believe? <br>
KIRA: I never knew you felt that way about me. <br>
ODO: I did everything I could to make sure you wouldn't find out. <br>
KIRA: It worked. Why didn't you ever say anything? <br>
ODO: I didn't think you could possibly care for me the way I care for
you. I suppose I was afraid of ruining what we had. Our friendship
meant everything to me. It still does. Maybe I shouldn't have said
anything. <br>
KIRA: It's not that. I was just thinking about all the times I came to
you for advice about Shakaar and Bareil. It must have been very hard
for you to listen to me go on about another man. <br>
ODO: No, I can't say I enjoyed it, but I wanted to be a good friend to
you. <br>
KIRA: You were. <br>
ODO: Nerys, I didn't come here expecting you to throw yourself in my
arms. But you're leaving here in two days. I'm never going to see you
again. All I'm asking is that you spend some time with me. Gaia is a
very beautiful place. I'd love to show it to you. <br>

that call? <br>
YEDRIN: I have to make that call because I'm responsible for what
happened here! Jadzia knows what I'm talking about. She's the one who
insisted that the Defiant investigate this planet. You know as well as
I do that you should have been more careful. You should have seen that
the barrier was unstable when you scanned it. <br>
DAX: But I didn't. I was so bent on making some great discovery that I
missed it. <br>
YEDRIN: And because of you, because of me, Kira died and forty eight
people were stranded here. You don't know what it was like to live with
that. For years, Benjamin, every time I looked at you all I could think
of was Jake and how because of me, he would never see his father again.
Eventually I had to accept the fact there was nothing I could do to
change things. I couldn't bring Kira back. All I could do was look to
the future, Benjamin, and make sure that we survived here no matter
what. This community is my responsibility. For two centuries, I have
watched it grow into something to be proud of. For generations these
people have worked to make a life for themselves here. They deserve a
chance to hang on to it. <br>
SISKO: I'm not denying that. I wish there was a way we could help you,
but my people have the right to go home to their families. And I will
not ask Kira to sacrifice her life for eight thousand people, for eight
million. No one has the right to ask that. I'm sorry, old man, but
there is nothing I can do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Evening, and children are playing catch nearby.) <br>
KIRA: Look at them. They have no idea what's going to happen. <br>
WORF: It is for the best. They are children. They would not understand.
<br>
KIRA: I'm not sure I understand. Eight thousand people, Worf. They have
to die because I have to go back to the station to be treated for some
condition I can't even tell I have. <br>
WORF: That is not the only reason we are going back. Do not blame
yourself, Major. <br>
KIRA: I'm going up to the ship. <br>
MIRANDA: It would've been a good crop this year. Spring came so early. <br>
GABRIEL: Miranda, is something wrong? Everyone's so quiet. <br>
MIRANDA: It's nothing you need to worry about. <br>
(Worf is by a fire.) <br>
PARELL: We came to tell you. There will be no feast tonight. <br>
WORF: I understand. This is not a time for celebration. <br>
BROTA: Tomorrow we will see the sun rise again, but no one here will
see it set. <br>
WORF: Join me. There is something I wish to say. It is a great honour
to know that my legacy has thrived on your world for so long. I can see
the Klingon heart beats strong here. <br>
BROTA: You honour us with your words. We have tried to live as you
taught us to. <br>
PARELL: We've never plowed fields or milked chattel. We've lived as
warriors, hunters. <br>
BROTA: Last year, I slew a yarbear three metres tall. Your mek'leth was
my only weapon. The beast maimed me, and for a time it seemed I would
die from my wounds. Now I wish I had. It would have been a warrior's
death. <br>
PARELL: He could have taken his place among the honoured dead in
Sto'Vo'Kor. <br>
WORF: Perhaps he will yet. <br>
BROTA: No. Ceasing to exist because my parents were never born? That is
not a death worthy of Sto'Vo'Kor. Kill me, Worf. I have no enemies to
fight, no glory to be won. Give me an honourable death. <br>
PARELL: Don't make us wait for the end like farm animals waiting for
slaughter. <br>
WORF: I will come to you tomorrow and do what you ask.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Why did you want to come back here? <br>
KIRA: I had to see it again so I could be sure. <br>
ODO: Sure about what? <br>
KIRA: That this is where I belong. The path the Prophets laid out for
me ends here. <br>
ODO: But not this time, Nerys. The Captain's taking you back to DS
Nine. <br>
KIRA: I can't let him do that. Not if it's going to cost eight thousand
lives. No, we have to let history take its course, even if it means I
have to die here. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: What? Have you lost your mind? <br>
BASHIR: Kira, if we don't go back to the station you'll die within a
few weeks. There's nothing I can do for you here. <br>
KIRA: I know that, Julian. I've accepted it. We've got to take the
Defiant back in time, otherwise we're cheating fate. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind cheating fate all the way home to
the station. <br>
DAX: Neither would I. But if we go home, eight thousand people are
going to cease to exist. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know those people. But I have a wife and kids back
home who need me. <br>
KIRA: Your family will be fine, Miles. The Prophets will take care of
them. <br>
O'BRIEN: No offence, but I don't believe in your Prophets. <br>
WORF: All Major Kira is saying is our families will survive no matter
what we do. The colonists will not. If she is willing to sacrifice her
life to save them, I am willing to remain here. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's easy for you to say. You hardly see your son. <br>
WORF: And you are afraid to face your destiny. <br>
O'BRIEN: We can sit here arguing destiny until we're blue in the face,
but the bottom line is, nobody has the right to tell me I can't go home
to my family. <br>
SISKO: I want to go home as much as you do, Chief. I'm just listening
to what everyone has to say. <br>
O'BRIEN: So we're not actually considering this? <br>
SISKO: No, we're not. <br>
KIRA: Captain. <br>
SISKO: Major, you've made your position clear. All right, people.
Dismissed.

WORF: By sunset this will all be gone. <br>
DAX: Taking a last look around? <br>
(Gabriel runs through the group. Sisko grabs him.) <br>
SISKO: Whoa. Gabriel, where are you going in such a hurry? <br>
GABRIEL: To the fields. It's time for planting. <br>
(They walk on to where everyone is getting the young plants ready for
the ground.) <br>
MIRANDA: Come on, Gabriel, there isn't much time. Put some of this on
your face. The sun's strong today. <br>
YEDRIN: Planting day has always been important here. It brings everyone
together. Somehow it feels right to see it through.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Most of our people help with the planting. Pushing
a motorised hand-plough, making planting holes. Compost goes in the
bottom and the plant on top. Kira is scattering seed. Miranda is
handing out the rooted plants.) <br>
MIRANDA: Here's one for you. Molly, take that from the bottom. <br>
MOLLY: Thank you. <br>
(Molly takes it to Bashir.) <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
(Then the plants are watered in.) <br>
O'BRIEN: The status report you asked for, sir. The repairs are
finished. The Defiant's ready to leave orbit. <br>
(Sisko reads the PADD.) <br>
MOLLY: Aren't you going to help? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm busy. <br>
MOLLY: You don't look busy. <br>
SISKO: She's an O'Brien, all right. Better get to it, Chief. <br>
(Sisko hands over his trowel. Worf and the Sons of Mogh arrived.) <br>
BROTA: You said there was an enemy for us to fight. <br>
WORF: They are attempting to plant their fields before the sun sets.
Time is their enemy. We should help them defeat it. <br>
BROTA: Bring the others. <br>
(And the sun sweeps on in its course. Molly brings O'Brien a plant.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Ah, great. You know, I have a little girl named Molly, too. <br>
MOLLY: Really? Can I meet her? <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll see. <br>
MOLLY: By summer, this plant will be taller than you. After the
harvested, I'll help my mother make gelm bread with it. <br>
WOMAN: Molly? <br>
(Molly runs off, O'Brien goes over to Sisko and Kira.) <br>
SISKO: Is something wrong? <br>
O'BRIEN: We can't do it. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
O'BRIEN: We can't let these people die.

YEDRIN: The navigational logs from the original crash. Download them
into the ship's autopilot and it'll match the original trajectory. That
should send the Defiant back to the right point in time. <br>
MIRANDA: I don't know how to thank you for what you're doing. <br>

KIRA: Please don't make it any harder than it already is. <br>
ODO: You have to go home, Nerys. You have to. <br>
KIRA: This isn't about me. This is about the eight thousand people down
on that planet, and their children and grandchildren. <br>
ODO: What about the children who'll never be born because the Defiant
doesn't return to DS Nine? <br>
KIRA: They don't exist yet. These people do. <br>
ODO: Nerys, just tell me one thing. If you'd known how I felt about
you, if I'd said something years ago, do you think things might have
been different? <br>

O'BRIEN: I've downloaded the recordings into a class four probe. It'll
start transmitting a location signal as soon as it clears the barrier. <br>
SISKO: Launch the probe, Chief. <br>
KIRA: It's time. <br>
SISKO: Transfer helm control to autopilot. <br>
DAX: Autopilot engaged. <br>
SISKO: Raise shields. <br>

WORF: We are breaking orbit. <br>
DAX: Coming around to four two mark seven. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm picking up an unusual temporal signature. <br>

DAX: Ten seconds to impact. Eight, seven, six, five, four <br>

SISKO: Try to override the autopilot. <br>
DAX: I can't. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're clearing the barrier. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Whoever changed our flight plan knew their
way around the computer system. They bypassed our security protocols
without leaving a trace. <br>
DAX: It must have been someone from the crew. <br>
SISKO: Or someone who used to be. <br>
DAX: Yedrin? But all he cared about was the settlement. What could have
changed his mind? <br>
SISKO: Seeing us again. Perhaps he decided he couldn't let us go
through with it. <br>

planet, came to Sickbay before he left the ship. <br>
KIRA: Oh? <br>
ODO: He linked with me. Now I know everything that happened. <br>
KIRA: The other day, when I told you about Shakaar and me not seeing
each other anymore, you seemed so uncomfortable. <br>
ODO: I'd come to accept the fact that you were involved with someone
else, then suddenly everything changed. <br>
KIRA: I don't know what to say. I'm still trying to sort everything
out. <br>
ODO: So am I. I think we both need time. There's something else the
other Odo wanted you to know. He was responsible for changing the
Defiant's flight plan. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
ODO: So that you wouldn't have to die. <br>
KIRA: I can't believe it. Eight thousand people! <br>
