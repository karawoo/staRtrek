QUARK: (coming down the stairs with a waiter) I thought I told you to
cancel that order. Now what am I supposed to do with five thousand
wrappages of
Cardassian yamok sauce. They're the only ones who could stomach that
swill. <br>
JAKE: Hey, Nog, are you going to play, or what? <br>
QUARK: You ordered it, you're going to pay for it. I'm going to take
half of your paycheck every week for the next six years.
From now on, no more Cardassian food in here ever. <br>
JAKE: Come on, Nog, it's your turn. <br>

NOG: Five thousand wrappages. That's a lot of yamok sauce. <br>
JAKE: Look, either take your turn, or I win. <br>
NOG: It'd be a shame to let it to go to waste. <br>
JAKE: That's it. Game over. <br>
NOG: Jake, I'm getting that tingle in the lobes. And when a lobe
tingles, it means only one thing. Opportunity. <br>
JAKE: What are you talking about? <br>

KIRA: Does that mean I can come in? <br>
MULLIBOK: No. No, I don't like uniforms either. I'm scared of them. We
had our fill of uniformed bullies. <br>

some chlorobicrobes. <br>
MULLIBOK: Is that right? That could be. Your family's farmers, then. <br>
KIRA: No but if I don't get on your good side soon, my arm's going to

NOG: Excuse me, sir. Are you the captain of the Lissepian cargo ship? <br>
CAPTAIN: That's right. <br>
NOG: And you do a lot of trading with the Cardassians? <br>
CAPTAIN: Why not? One thing about Cardassians, they pay their bills. <br>
NOG: Yes, I've heard that. I've also heard they love their yamok sauce.

you're wasting your time. I'm not carrying any. <br>

CAPTAIN: I'll give you a hundred gross of self-sealing stem bolts. Some
Bajoran ordered them from me, and now he can't pay. <br>
JAKE: Self-sealing stem bolts? <br>
CAPTAIN: Top grade merchandise. You won't find a better stem bolt in
this sector. <br>
NOG: I don't think so. We deal strictly in latinum. <br>

JAKE: What are we going to do with yamok sauce? <br>
NOG: Sir, I've discussed it with my partner, and you have a deal. <br>
CAPTAIN: Good. I'll meet you at cargo bay nine at twenty one hundred

DAX [OC]: Enjoy supper. Dax out. <br>
MULLIBOK: Here. (hands Kira the root) Wash it off first, and then you
scrape the skin off. <br>
KIRA: (to the woman) You don't talk much. <br>
MULLIBOK: No, they don't talk at all. The Cardassians took care of
that. They escaped up to this moon eighteen years ago. I've been here
forty. We did real well together. Oh, get out the plates and utensils,
like a good girl. That cupboard right over there. <br>

You know, you look real good even from this angle. But you know
something? You walk like a carnivorous rastipod. <br>

MULLIBOK: Nerys. Well, Nerys, I'm Mullibok, and these roots are really
going to take three hours to cook, so you might as well just sit down
and relax yourself, child. It's going to be tasty. <br>
KIRA: Mullibok, they begin tapping the core of this moon in seven days.
<br>
MULLIBOK: I know. <br>
KIRA: You are only three people. This project is going to benefit
thousands, hundreds of thousands. <br>
MULLIBOK: I made myself unconcerned with that forty years ago when I
ran away from a Cardassian labour camp on your precious Bajor. <br>
KIRA: What we're trying to create now is what you weren't allowed to
have then. It can be your Bajor, too. <br>
MULLIBOK: This is where I live. This is my home. <br>
KIRA: You can have a home on Bajor with people to welcome you and your
friends. Life'll be different, yes, but it'll be fine. Really. <br>
MULLIBOK: No. I told you, my life's here. If I leave, I'll die. So I'd
rather die here.

some storage space for the shipment of lokar beans that are due in
tomorrow. Is it okay if I stack them on top of the yamok sauce? If I
can reach that high. <br>

MULLIBOK: I stowed away on a Cardassian survey vessel which was making
stops all through the Bajoran system. They were looking for possible
mining sites. Anyway, when we got here to Jeraddo, I overpowered the
crew and I stole whatever I'd need to start building my life here. <br>
KIRA: You overpowered the crew yourself? <br>
MULLIBOK: There were only six of them. That was fortunate for me,
because I was somewhat weakened a bit by the captivity and starvation.
Anyway, here I was, the first person ever to settle on this moon, and
the only trouble was that I didn't have any kind of farm implements. So
once again starvation and I were staring each other in the face. I'm
not boring you? <br>
KIRA: No, no. I want to hear who won. <br>
MULLIBOK: Well, it was mind over matter. Every twenty-six hours I'd
just tightened up my waist-belt another notch, and that way my belly
didn't know that it was shrinking. <br>
KIRA: Excuse me? <br>
MULLIBOK: You asked me to tell you how I got started here, which I'm
trying very politely to do. Now will you kindly let me finish. <br>
KIRA: I assume you found some food before you ran out of belt notches. <br>
MULLIBOK: Are you telling the story or am I? <br>
KIRA: By all means. I can't wait to hear how it ends. <br>
MULLIBOK: Obviously I was going to have to plant and harvest a crop. So
I did what any person would do who had to build an entire world for
himself. First I rolled back and forth on the ground til it
surrendered. Then I went down on my hands and knees and I started to
plow using nothing but my fingernails, mind you. I plowed every last
furrow in that field straight as a plumb line. <br>
KIRA: Now that is inventive. <br>
MULLIBOK: If I came across a deposit of mineralised clay, what I'd do
is just grind it up in my teeth. That way it enriched the soil.
Baltrim, how about some of that wonderful wine here? What I'm telling
you, Major. I tamed this place. Me. <br>
KIRA: I believe you. <br>
MULLIBOK: You look like a bit of a fighter yourself. <br>
KIRA: Well, on Bajor, we had to be. <br>
MULLIBOK: To get rid of the Cardassians. Mindless butchers. <br>
KIRA: We paid them back. <br>
MULLIBOK: I bet you did. They probably never knew what hit them. I'm
sorry I missed the fun. <br>
KIRA: Fun? <br>
MULLIBOK: Must have been like spearing kandippers in a bottle. <br>
KIRA: Wait a minute, are you serious? You know what the Cardassians
were like, what weapons they had. We didn't stand a chance against
them. <br>
MULLIBOK: How'd you beat them, then? <br>
KIRA: We beat them because, because we hung on like fanatics. <br>
MULLIBOK: Hung on like fanatics. I got to remember that.

Then I can temper my baking pots, put some colourful lids on them.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it. <br>
KIRA: I appreciate that you're trying to hang on here. I sympathise,
but you can't stay. The minute they start tapping the crust, it'll
release carbon and sulphur compounds that'll make the air unbreathable.
<br>
MULLIBOK: The Cardassians probably told you you didn't stand a chance,
either. Did you surrender? <br>
KIRA: No. <br>

long. It would mean waiting a full year before we can extract any
meaningful amount of energy. I wish we had the time to be more

JAKE: He doesn't have any latinum. Let's exchange for something. <br>
NOG: I don't want something. I want latinum. <br>
CH'ANO [OC]: I can't hear you. Can I interest you in a piece of land? <br>
JAKE: Land is good. <br>
NOG: For what? It's nothing but dirt. <br>
JAKE: How much land? <br>
CH'ANO [OC]: I can let you have seven tessipates. <br>
JAKE: Seven sounds good. <br>
NOG: First yamok sauce, then stem bolts, now tessipates, and still no
profit. <br>
JAKE: We're getting closer. I can feel it. <br>
NOG: You can? <br>
JAKE: I think so. <br>
CH'ANO [OC]: Do we have a deal? <br>
JAKE: We'd have to see proof that you own the land. <br>
CH'ANO [OC]: Naturally. You'll get a transmission on that by twelve
hundred hours. <br>
JAKE: You just bought yourself some stem bolts. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
JAKE: Land! <br>
NOG: Dirt.

which punctured your peritoneum. It's serious, and if you try to move
around, you'll make it worse. <br>
MULLIBOK: Another uniform. <br>
BASHIR: Doctor Julian Bashir, Starfleet. Major Kira sent for me. <br>
MULLIBOK: She did, huh? You're backwards, Nerys, I told you. <br>
(Kira leaves) <br>
MULLIBOK: With me unconscious, she could have swept us all off of here
with no trouble at all. My friends Baltrim and Keena? <br>
BASHIR: They've been evacuated to Bajor. I'll be taking you back to our

KIRA: Really? <br>
BASHIR: He's got to be cared for. I'm going to take him without his

sir. She simply removed her uniform tunic and started building. <br>
SISKO: Well Doctor, right now she stands a pretty good chance of being
out of uniform permanently. I'm going to tell Minister Toran that she's
remained temporarily on Jeraddo at your request. <br>
BASHIR: But sir, that isn't true. <br>
SISKO: Make it true, Doctor. Now, please. <br>
BASHIR: Commander, I'd advise that Major Kira remain on Jeraddo for
humanitarian reasons. How long? <br>
SISKO: The next day or two. <br>

MULLIBOK: What's that? <br>
KIRA: It's for deep bruises. Don't ask my why it works. I'm not the
doctor. <br>
MULLIBOK: What're they going to do to you for staying here? <br>
KIRA: Probably the same thing they're going to do to you. I don't
really know. <br>
MULLIBOK: What are you so angry about? <br>
KIRA: I don't really know. When I was very small, I remember there was
this tree right outside my window. It was the ugliest, most gnarled and
battered old tree I've ever seen. Even the birds stayed away from it. <br>
MULLIBOK: But you loved it. <br>
KIRA: I hated it. Because it'd grown so huge that its branches blotted
out the sun for kellipates. And its roots buried themselves so deep in
the soil nothing else could grow there. It was a big, selfish, annoying
<br>
MULLIBOK: Nasty <br>
KIRA: Nasty, nasty old tree. <br>
MULLIBOK: Sounds to me like it had a lot of character. <br>
KIRA: A lot. <br>
MULLIBOK: So what happened? Did you cut it down? <br>
KIRA: I don't know yet. <br>
SISKO [OC]: Sisko to Kira. <br>
KIRA: Commander. <br>
SISKO [OC]: I'm preparing to beam down. <br>
KIRA: I don't think that's a good idea. <br>
SISKO [OC]: Major, either I'm coming down or you're coming up. <br>
MULLIBOK: He doesn't have much faith in you, does he? <br>

it) <br>

KIRA: Wait a minute. Don't speak for me. <br>
SISKO: You know, you're causing a lot of trouble. <br>
MULLIBOK: I can't tell you how delighted I am to hear it. How many of
your Federation uniforms are you planning to send after me? Forty?
Fifty? <br>
SISKO: I don't think it'll come to that. <br>
MULLIBOK: That depends on how bad you want to get rid of me. <br>
SISKO: Mister Mullibok, I'm here because I'm concerned about my first
officer. <br>
MULLIBOK: What about her? <br>
SISKO: By staying here, she's jeopardising her career. <br>
KIRA: Would you go back to bed. <br>
MULLIBOK: You quit telling me what to do! <br>
SISKO: Major, can I see you outside for a minute? <br>
MULLIBOK: Talk to him as long as you want. Why don't you tell him the
story about your tree. <br>
KIRA: Be quiet. <br>
MULLIBOK: There was this big, ugly tree. <br>
SISKO: Go on. <br>
MULLIBOK: Never mind. <br>
(Mullibok goes back inside, and Sisko and Kira go over to the kiln) <br>
SISKO: I can see why you like him. <br>
KIRA: What can I do for you, Commander? <br>
SISKO: You and I have a material subsistence report to finish by the
end of the week. <br>
KIRA: I don't think I'm going to be able to help you with that. <br>
SISKO: It's part of the liaison officer's job. <br>
KIRA: I know. <br>
SISKO: I don't like the prospect of having to break in a new one. <br>
(Kira resumes work on the kiln) <br>
SISKO: You have a job to do here, Major, and you're not doing it. <br>
KIRA: It's not as simple as that. <br>
SISKO: I'm not saying it's simple, I'm saying it can't wait. Look, I
understand you're used to sympathising with the underdog. You've spent
your life fighting to overcome impossible odds just like he's doing.
But you have to realise something, Major. You're on the other side now.
Pretty uncomfortable, isn't it? <br>
KIRA: It's awful. <br>
SISKO: When I first met you, Major, I thought you were hostile and
arrogant. But I was wrong. Bajor needs you, and I need you. I like you
and I don't want you to be hurt. So, as a friend, I'm here to remind
you that his fate is already decided. Yours isn't. <br>
KIRA: Thank you. <br>
SISKO: There'll be a runabout standing by. One to beam up.

JAKE: About what? <br>
NOG: Latinum. And how we don't have any. All we have is dirt. <br>
JAKE: How many times do I have to tell you. It's not dirt, it's land. <br>
NOG: What are we supposed to do with this land? <br>
JAKE: Sell it, I guess. <br>
NOG: To who? <br>
JAKE: Why do I have to think of everything. <br>
NOG: We should've kept the stem bolts. <br>
JAKE: Land is better than bolts. <br>
NOG: How do you know? <br>
JAKE: You can build things on land. <br>
NOG: You can't build anything without bolts. <br>
JAKE: Just throw down a card. <br>
QUARK: And you say they're based here on the station? <br>
ODO: That's correct. <br>
QUARK: The Noh-Jay Consortium. No, never heard of it. Why do you ask? <br>
ODO: I was contacted by a government official this morning. They want
to build a reclamation facility on a strip of land owned by four
different people. Three of them have agreed to sell, but the government
doesn't know how to reach the fourth, this Noh-Jay Consortium. <br>
QUARK: You mean the government can't build without that one piece of
land? <br>
ODO: Apparently not. <br>
QUARK: What a wonderful opportunity for profit. <br>
JAKE: I told you that land was better than bolts. <br>
QUARK: And you think that I'm part of this consortium? <br>
ODO: I think very little goes on here without your knowledge. <br>
QUARK: True. This time, however, someone has failed to include me. <br>
ODO: Are you telling me you're not involved? <br>
QUARK: Not yet, but that will be remedied. You can tell the Bajorans
I'll be opening negotiations with them shortly. <br>

QUARK: Go sweep the floor. <br>
NOG: It's important. <br>
QUARK: All right, make it fast. <br>
NOG: I have a business opportunity that might interest you. It'll only
cost you five bars of gold-pressed latinum. <br>
