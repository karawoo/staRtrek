rules of war. If he'd executed Davy Crockett at the Alamo he would have
considered it a point of pride. <br>
BASHIR: All right. Put it this way. In eighteen thirty six Davy
Crockett was what, forty nine? Quite old for the standards of the time.
His days as an Indian fighter were well behind him. He was just an
ex-Congressman, all reputation. Now this is not a man who was about to
fight till his last breath, Miles. The situation was hopeless, he was
out of ammunition, the Mexican army was swarming the Alamo's
battlements. He would have surrendered. It's as logical as that.
Simple. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not saying it couldn't have happened. I'm just saying
there's no proof. <br>
WORF: You are both wrong. The only real question is whether you believe
in the legend of Davy Crockett or not. If you do, then there should be
no doubt in your mind that he died the death of a hero. If you do not
believe in the legend, then he was just a man and it does not matter
how he died. <br>
(Worf leaves.) <br>
BASHIR: Well, I guess that settles that. <br>
O'BRIEN: I guess so. </font></p>

KOR: Nuq'nuh, Worf. It's good to see you, my friend. <br>
WORF: I welcome you to my home. May I offer you some refreshment? <br>
KOR: I would be honoured to share a bottle of bloodwine with the Son of
Mogh. I heard the news about Jadzia. <br>
WORF: She died a warrior. <br>
KOR: I expected nothing less. (Worf hands him a goblet) To absent
comrades. Twenty three oh nine. Very good. <br>
WORF: Sit. <br>
KOR: The war goes well for you, Worf? A long list of victories to your
credit, I trust? <br>
WORF: I have been fortunate. <br>
KOR: The way of the warrior is not a humble path. Show some pride in
your accomplishments! You've earned it. <br>
WORF: I will try. And does the war go well for you, Kor? <br>
KOR: No, Worf. It does not go well for me. It seems my services are not
required in the present conflict. <br>
WORF: But you are Kor, a Dahar Master, the man who held the Korma Pass
against T'nag. Your reputation alone should have assured you a command.
<br>
KOR: I also have a reputation for a certain ruthless quality toward
those who would stand in my way. Mind you, it is not entirely
undeserved. In truth, I rather enjoy being feared by my fellow
officers. However, there's a price to be paid for such singled-minded
devotion to one's ambition. I made enemies. Perhaps more than were
necessary. I have no influence left in the Empire. Even as our entire
race grapples with the Dominion there's no place for an old man with
too many enemies and not enough friends. That's why I've come here
tonight. It is not easy for me to beg you for help, but I have nowhere
else to turn. Help me fight again, Worf. Help me end my life as I've
lived it. As a warrior.

MARTOK: How many more reports does the High Council require? <br>
DAROK: As many as last time. And Starfleet is still waiting for your
signature on these repair requests. <br>
MARTOK: There will come a day, Darok, when your services as my aide may
no longer be required. <br>
DAROK: I look forward to that day with great anticipation. Until then <br>

MARTOK: Ah, Worf, good to see you. Thank you, Darok. <br>
(Darok leaves.) <br>
MARTOK: It's a pity Captain Sisko frowns on summary executions. What
can I do for you? <br>
WORF: Kor, the Dahar Master, came to see me last night. He has been
unable to find a command and I <br>
MARTOK: Tell me you're not going to ask me to give that man a ship! <br>
WORF: Well, I had hoped that <br>
MARTOK: Then your hopes are in vain. That man is not welcome in my

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTOK: I plan to attack the Trelka Five starbase,
then push deeper into Cardassian territory. I'll hit the Manora
shipyards, the Jem'Hadar breeding facility on Sheva Two, the supply
depots in the Borias Cluster. <br>
SISKO: It would take half the Ninth Fleet just to destroy Trelka Five. <br>
MARTOK: I don't intend to destroy the base, just damage it. Throw them
off balance and then move on to the next target. Imagine the chaos
we'll cause once we're in behind their lines. <br>
SISKO: A cavalry raid. Ancient Earth soldiers mounted on horseback.
They had the speed to charge behind enemy lines to stir up trouble, and
the mobility to keep from being caught. How many ships will you take? <br>
MARTOK: Five birds of prey. Battle cruisers are too slow, too unwieldy
for a mission like this. <br>
SISKO: Do you want to take the Defiant? <br>
MARTOK: Perhaps the Defiant should remain here, just in case the
Jem'Hadar try their own cavalry raid. But it may be prudent for the
Defiant and a dozen or so other starships to be waiting for us when we
return. <br>
SISKO: You mean you might be bringing company back with you? <br>
MARTOK: I'm sure you'll be ready to welcome them. <br>
SISKO: With phasers charged.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A female officer is giving her updates to Martok
and Darok.) <br>
KOLANA: Our disruptor targeting sensors need to be replaced as well as
our guidance system relays. <br>
MARTOK: Make a note of that for Chief O'Brien. He should give the
Ch'Tang first priority. (Worf approaches) So, if you have something to
ask me do it now before Darok buries me under more paperwork. <br>
WORF: I wish to speak with you about Kor. Now I know that you have
strong feelings about this <br>
MARTOK: Clear the bridge! <br>
(Worf and Martok are left alone.) <br>
MARTOK: I did not expect to hear anything further on this subject from
you. <br>
WORF: And I did not expect to be forbidden to speak with you on any
subject. Have I become a shuVak to be ordered about like Darok? <br>
MARTOK: No, of course not. Very well. Talk and be done with it. <br>
WORF: Kor came to see me, asking my help as a friend. He is an old man
with no family and no influence left in the Empire. He asked nothing
except for the chance to fight and die as a Klingon warrior. I told him
I would speak with you about finding him a command in the fleet. <br>
MARTOK: I would not give that man the gnawed bones of my last meal,
much less command of a ship. <br>
WORF: But why? There is no blood feud between our Houses, and Kor has
said he has not even met you. <br>
MARTOK: You can wound a man without ever seeing his face. When I was a
boy, my family still lived in the lowlands of Ketha Province. We had
very little, but it didn't matter. We were a family of warriors.
Fifteen generations had served as soldiers of the Empire, but my father
had higher hopes for me. He wanted his son to become an officer. It
took a great deal of effort, but eventually he found someone willing to
sponsor me. I passed my entrance exam on my first attempt and all that
remained was final approval by the oversight council. A simple
formality. My application was rejected by one member of that council.
Kor. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
MARTOK: Why? Kor's family descends from the Imperial Court itself. Kor
is of the blood, born to rule by the divine will of Kahless! And what
was I? A boy from the Ketha lowlands. He could not bear the thought of
someone like me joining the elite officer ranks. And so, to my father's
embarrassment and my everlasting shame, my application was denied. And
with the mark of Kor on my record I could not join even as a common
soldier. I spent five years as a civilian labourer aboard General
ShiVang's flagship. Then, as fortune would have it, the Romulans made a
foolhardy attempt to board our ship. I earned a battlefield commission.
Unfortunately, my father did not live to see that glorious day. And if
Kor had had his way, I would still be a civilian on that ship, cleaning
the officers' mess. <br>
WORF: I understand. But I must tell you that using my own authority, I
appointed Kor an officer in the Ninth Fleet. <br>
MARTOK: Made him an officer, just like that. That's the difference
between his name and mine. His opens doors, mine closes them. <br>
WORF: I did not anticipate that <br>
MARTOK: It's done. Your apology is not sought. But know this, Worf. Kor
is your responsibility. I want nothing to do with him.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KOR: Do you remember breaking into the Duke's harem
on Renavi? <br>
EZRI: How could I forget that? That is one of Curzon's favourite
memories. Hi. <br>
WORF: Hello. <br>
KOR: Come and join us, my friend. <br>
EZRI: I am on duty. I'll see you later. It's good to see you again,
Kor. <br>
(Ezri leaves.) <br>
KOR: Still the same old Dax, and yet not. <br>
WORF: General Martok will not give you a command. <br>
KOR: Kesh! <br>
WORF: He says that you struck his name from an officers list because
his family comes from the Ketha lowlands. <br>
KOR: Did I? I don't recall. Of course, there were so many officer
lists. I suppose it's possible. <br>
WORF: It is an unworthy reason to bar a man from serving the Empire. <br>
KOR: Worf, you've been living among this democratic rabble for too
long. I know your bloodline. We both come from noble Houses. Among our
people that still counts for something. If Martok is a true Klingon, he
should appreciate that. <br>
WORF: He does not. <br>
KOR: Did he revoke my commission? <br>
WORF: No. You will serve aboard the Ch'Tang as Third Officer. <br>
KOR: Third? Oh, well, no matter. I've overcome greater obstacles. Thank
you, Worf. You're a true friend. <br>
WORF: You will report aboard at oh seven hundred. And stay out of
Martok's way. <br>

EZRI: The usual. I have the same conversation over and over again.
Everyone's shocked at first, then they start scanning my face for signs
of the person they knew as Dax. It can't be. Is it really you? Oh, I do
see a little Jadzia in the eyes, a little Curzon in the smile. <br>
KIRA: Isn't there a period of adjustment that joined Trills have to go
through where people are comparing them to previous hosts? I'm sure
it'll pass. <br>
EZRI: You're right. The last five Dax hosts went through this. That
wasn't bad. You'd make a pretty good counsellor. You want to trade
jobs? <br>
KIRA: Oh, yeah, people would love bringing their problems to me. You
dreamed about what? You're crazy. Now get out of my office. Next
patient! <br>
EZRI: Funny you should mention dreams. Ever since my conversation with
Kor, I've had the most intense dreams about him. <br>
KIRA: Like what? <br>
EZRI: Being on a Klingon bridge together, going off into battle,
drinking bloodwine, which still makes me gag by the way, singing songs.
A part of me wants to be out there with him now. I hope he's all right.
I mean, I know I'm sort of contradicting what I just said about wanting
to set myself apart from my previous hosts, but the memories I have of
being with him are so vivid, I can't bear the thought of losing him.
I'd give almost anything for the chance to be together one more time.
The two of us, side by side, just like it used to be. <br>

KOLANA: Let me have the honour to welcome the Dahar Master to the
humble mess hall of the Ch'Tang. <br>
KOR: Sit, sit. You do me too much honour. On this voyage I am but the
Third Officer. I expect no special treatment. <br>
WORF: Have you settled on an attack plan for the starbase on Trelka
Five? <br>
MARTOK: I'm going to send the Malpara and Ning'tao in ahead of the rest
of the squadron. They'll make a single strafing run on the base and
then head out of the system. When the enemy sends out their repair
crews to assess the damage, then the rest of the squadron will decloak.
With any luck, we'll catch them not only unprepared but with their
entire damage control effort underway. <br>
KOR: Excellent! An excellent plan, General. <br>
MARTOK: I'm glad you approve. <br>
KOR: Of course. It's the same tactic Kang and I used against the
Federation in the battle of Caleb Four. <br>

seem. <br>
KOLANA: We would be honoured if you would tell us about Caleb Four. <br>
DAROK: Tell the tale. <br>
SYNON: Yes, tell us! <br>
KOR: Well, there's not much to tell really. The battle was over almost
before the Federation knew it had begun. I commanded the first division
from the Klothos, one of the old D Five cruisers. Kang commanded the
second division. Now, you must remember that in those days, the
cloaking device was a new piece of technology. There were only a
handful of engineers in the Imperial Fleet who knew how to operate
them. Before we left Chronos, I spent three days in the engine room
taking the device apart with my bare hands and then putting it back
together again. Now this would come in handy later in the battle, as
you'll see. </font></p>

MARTOK: Still, you're his friend. It must have been difficult for you. <br>
WORF: A friend would not have put him in that position in the first
place. <br>
MARTOK: I've hated his name for almost thirty years. I've dreamt of the
moment when I would finally see him stripped of his rank and title,
when he would suddenly find himself without a friend in the world,
without the power of his birthright. Well, I've had that moment now.
And I took no joy from it. Have you thought about what will become of
him when we return to Deep Space Nine? <br>
WORF: I plan to speak with Chancellor Gowron to try and find Kor some
assignment on the homeworld. <br>
MARTOK: I'll have a word with Gowron as well. <br>
KOLANA [OC]: Bridge to General Martok. <br>
MARTOK: Yes? <br>
KOLANA [OC]: Pardon the interruption, sir. Our sensors have detected a
large body of enemy ships. <br>
MARTOK: On my way.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Klingon Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTOK: Where are they? <br>
KOLANA: Their warp signatures are bearing directly astern. They're
Jem'Hadar fighters and they appear to be pursuing us. <br>
MARTOK: How can that be? <br>
WORF: The lead ship is using some kind of long range tachyon scanner to
penetrate our cloaks. <br>
SYNON: Does the Dominion possess such a device? <br>
MARTOK: They do now. <br>
WORF: How many ships? <br>
KOLANA: I've identified ten vessels so far, and they're gaining on us. <br>
WORF: How long before we are within their weapons range? <br>
KOLANA: Two hours, twelve minutes. <br>
MARTOK: Helm, have you located the Defiant? <br>
SYNON: Yes, sir. They're waiting for us in the Kalandra sector, with
seven Federation starships. It will take us three hours, forty five
minutes to reach them. <br>
WORF: If the Jem'Hadar could be forced to drop out of warp for only ten
minutes, they would not have time to catch up with us before we
rendezvous with the Defiant. <br>
MARTOK: A fine theory, but how do we execute it? <br>
WORF: We could disrupt their warp fields with an inverse graviton
burst. It would force them to drop to impulse until the gravitons
dissipated. <br>
KOLANA: We would need to generate a massive burst to disrupt the warp
fields of a fleet that size. <br>
WORF: A single bird of prey could do it by diverting warp power to the
main deflector. <br>
MARTOK: How long would that delay them? <br>
KOLANA: They could reinitialise their warp cores in less than two
minutes. <br>
WORF: If I could engage them in battle while they're still at impulse,
that would delay them even longer. I know I could do it. <br>
MARTOK: What do you mean, you could do it? <br>
WORF: The Orantho's Captain and First Officer are dead, and the
Slivin's deflector is damaged. It cannot generate a graviton burst. And
the Ning'tao's Captain is too young and inexperienced. I am the logical
choice. <br>
MARTOK: But Worf, this means that you'd be sacrificing the entire crew
of the Ning'tao. <br>
WORF: I have thought about that. We could beam most of the crew over
before I take command. I would only need six volunteers. <br>
MARTOK: Signal the Ning'tao. Tell them to prepare for a change in
command. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KOR: Yes? <br>
(Darok enters with a tray.) <br>
KOR: I am not hungry. <br>
DAROK: The food is for me. I haven't eaten in hours. Men of our
generation never stood on ceremony. We ate when we were hungry, we
fought when we were angered. Oh, I miss the simplicity of those days. <br>
KOR: I miss a great deal about those days. <br>
DAROK: The warriors on this ship, they don't know what they've missed.
But such is the way with children. They often let the promise of the
future obscure the glories of the past. <br>
KOR: Is there a point to this nostalgic indulgence? <br>
DAROK: Only that they are children. Even Martok who, for all his flaws,
is a great man, even Martok is but a child compared to you or me. They
are quick to judge and slow to forgive. They still have much to learn.
We are being pursued by a Jem'Hadar fleet. Worf believes he can stop
them with a single ship. <br>
KOR: How? <br>
(Darok hands him a PADD.) <br>
DAROK: It's a good plan, but it has one flaw. It depends entirely on
Worf successfully engaging the whole enemy fleet, if only for a short
time. <br>
KOR: It can be done. The key is to confuse their sensors in the opening
moments with a spread of torpedoes. <br>
DAROK: Perhaps. But it would take a man with three times his experience
to accomplish such a feat. And such a man would have to be certain of
his abilities. <br>
KOR: Such a man would not take the job unless he were certain. <br>
DAROK: It has been an honour serving with you, Kor, son of Rynar.

WORF: Yes. <br>
KOR: I wanted to wish you well. I look forward to seeing you at the

WORF: As do I. <br>
KOR: Do you have any message you want me to convey to Jadzia? <br>
(Kor hypo's Worf.) <br>
KOR: When I reach the halls of the hallowed dead, I will find your
beloved and remind her that her husband is a noble warrior, and that he
still loves no one but her. Goodbye, my friend. Live well. <br>

MARTOK: On the bridge? <br>
DAROK: If they succeed, you can drink to their courage, and if they
fail, you can still drink to their courage. <br>
KOLANA: The Ning'tao is closing on the enemy. She's initiated the
graviton burst. Their warp fields are destabilising, They're dropping
to impulse. <br>
MARTOK: By Kahless's hand, how many? <br>
KOLANA: All of them. The Ning'tao has dropped out of warp. She's
engaging the enemy. <br>
MARTOK: Die well, Worf. <br>
WORF: Today was not my day to die. <br>
MARTOK: Worf! But then who? Kor! <br>
WORF: He surprised me outside the transporter room with a hypospray. <br>
MARTOK: I hope that old fool understands what he's doing. How goes the
battle? <br>
KOLANA: We're approaching the limit of our sensor range, but it appears
that the enemy formation has collapsed. The Ning'tao is manoeuvring
rapidly. She's taking heavy fire from the Jem'Hadar. I've lost contact.
<br>
MARTOK: One ship against ten. It doesn't seem possible. <br>
WORF: He will succeed. He is Kor, the Dahar Master. <br>
(A little later.) <br>
KOLANA: He's done it. The Jem'Hadar are out of time. They can no longer
overtake us before we reach the Defiant. <br>
MARTOK: How? How did that pompous old man hold off an entire Jem'Hadar
fleet with only one ship? <br>
WORF: Does it matter? <br>
MARTOK: Darok, give me that bottle. <br>
(Martok knocks off the cork with his knife.) <br>
MARTOK: To Kor. A Dahar Master and noble warrior to the end. <br>
