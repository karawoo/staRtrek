ODO: Let go? <br>
QUARK: The place is almost deserted. There hasn't been a ship in for
three days and yet you just sit here like a Baneriam Hawk looking for
prey. This is your chance to relax. I could set you up with a terrific
holosuite programme. <br>
ODO: Thank you, but I don't accept gifts from the likes of you. <br>
QUARK: Who said anything about gifts? You pay like everyone else. I'm
just trying to get you into the tent. <br>
ODO: I have no time for fantasies. <br>
QUARK: Ah. No imagination, huh? <br>
ODO: Waste of time. Too many people dream of places they'll never go,
wish for things they'll never have, instead of paying adequate
attention to their real lives. <br>
QUARK: I could create a shape-shifter playmate for you. The two of you
could intermingle. <br>
ODO: You're disgusting. <br>
QUARK: It's a living. <br>
(Jake comes through with his baseball bat and glove.) <br>
ODO: You're not allowing young Mister Sisko in your holosuites, I hope.
<br>
QUARK: It's not what you think. <br>
ODO: It better not be. <br>
QUARK: You see that thing on his hand? It's a baseball mitten. Every
afternoon, the boy goes up to play. His father brought a
programme with famous players. You ever hear of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/speaktr01.shtml" target="_blank"> Tris Speaker</a> or
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml" target="_blank"> Ted Williams</a> or Buck Bokai? <br>
ODO: Afraid not. <br>
QUARK: Neither had I until I made it my business to find out. With all
these humans coming now, the true entrepreneur knows how to sniff the
wind. Try it. Go ahead. <br>
ODO: I have no sense of smell. <br>
QUARK: You don't need one to detect the scent of opportunity. <br>
ODO: Opportunity. <br>
QUARK: Family entertainment. That's the future, Odo. There's a fortune
to be made. Little holo-creatures running around, rides and games for
the kiddies, Ferengis in every doorway selling useless souvenirs. <br>
ODO: You're going to replace all your sexual holo-programs with family
entertainment? <br>
QUARK: No, no, no, I'm expanding. I'm negotiating to lease the space
next door so I can use the same holo-generators. <br>
ODO: You're still disgusting. <br>
QUARK: Till the day I die. <br>

DAX: You seemed to be concentrating just fine on the junior Lieutenant
at the reception for Captain Stadius. <br>
BASHIR: She was a poor substitute for you. <br>
DAX: And the Betazoid envoy who was here last week. <br>
BASHIR: A barely adequate substitute for you. <br>
DAX: Julian, you are a wonderful friend. I enjoy the time we spend
together. <br>
BASHIR: Stop. You're driving a stake through my heart. <br>

KIRA: We were just looking at an unusual energy reading. <br>
DAX: Elevated thoron emissions in the plasma field. <br>
SISKO: We thought it might be an environmental byproduct created by the
increased traffic to this area. <br>
DAX: It could be. Ships have always avoided the Denorios Belt. We have
no idea how the presence of so many warp and impulse engines might
affect it. The question is, is this going to cause us any problems? <br>

O'BRIEN: Rumpelstiltskin, right. And the next day, when the little man
came and asked, 'Now, Mrs Queen, what is my name?' She said at first,
'Are you called Jack?' 'No,' he answered. 'Are you called Harry?' 'No,'
he answered. And then she said, 'Then perhaps your name is' <br>
MOLLY: Rumpelstiltskin. <br>
O'BRIEN: Rumpelstiltskin. And at the sound of his own name, the old man
was so furious that he stamped his foot, shaking the entire kingdom,
and he broke in two and disappeared. And the King and Queen and their
daughter lived happily ever after. Good night, little one. Sweet
dreams. <br>

him) It must be this Larosian virus that's been going around. How do
you feel? <br>
DAX: Wonderful. (and carries on kissing him) <br>
BASHIR: No fever. It must be me. It must be me. It must be me. Must be
an allergic reaction to the replicated antipasto I had at lunch.
Perhaps, I must be hallucinating. <br>

on our hands. Lieutenant Jadzia Dax and Doctor Julian Bashir, I'd like
you to meet Harmon Bokai, a baseball player from the London Kings who's
been dead for two hundred years. <br>
BUCK: Don't look at me. I can't figure it out either. <br>
SISKO: And a medieval fairy tale character named Rumpelstiltskin. <br>
RUMPELSTILTSKIN: Fine, now everyone knows my name. <br>
SISKO: Until today, he only existed in storybooks. <br>

be redesignated Dax 2) <br>
DAX 2: Thoron emissions? <br>
DAX: I think you'd better ask me, Benjamin. <br>
(After the adverts, Bashir is scanning Buck with his ever-present
tricorder.) <br>
BUCK: I was hitting a few to the boy. He's really been moving well onto
the ball lately, Ben. We would've worked on some baserunning except he
was getting hungry and I realised I was too. <br>
KIRA: A hologram with an appetite? <br>
BUCK: Hologram? <br>
BASHIR: On the contrary, Major, he's quite real. They all seem to be. <br>
BUCK: What the hell are they talking about, Ben? <br>
SISKO: You. You're not actually Buck Bokai. <br>
BUCK: So how come I'm wearing his uniform? <br>
SISKO: You're a holographic image of Buck Bokai that I created so Jake
and I could play ball with you. <br>
(Dax 2 starts fawning over Bashir again.) <br>
BUCK: But I remember. I remember all the games, all the opening days.
The home run that won the forty two World Series. The squeaker that
went under Eddie Newsom's glove. The day I broke <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/d/dimagjo01.shtml" target="_blank"> DiMaggio's</a> consecutive streak. <br>
SISKO: I programmed it into the computer. All of it. Every statistic. <br>
RUMPELSTILTSKIN: What foreign tongue are they speaking? <br>
O'BRIEN: This one didn't come out of any holosuite. <br>
SISKO: But he did come out of your imagination, just as Buck came out
of Jake's. <br>
RUMPELSTILTSKIN: His imagination? <br>
DAX 2: Then I must have come out of your imagination, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: Not necessarily. Well, maybe. How could this sort of thing
possibly happen? <br>
DAX: A subspace disruption. Maybe some kind of dimensional shift. <br>
DAX: I didn't see an anomaly when I scanned the plasma field, but it
could have been so small the sensors missed it. <br>
DAX 2: Julian, let's go to your quarters. <br>

have time for us anymore. I could've played five more years if they
hadn't killed the game. <br>

We should abandon the whole thing. <br>
BUCK: Not yet. I made a connection with mine. A curious one. I sense a
feeling from him. An affection for this ballplayer who died two hundred
years before he was even born. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: A Vulcan science mission to the Hanoli
rift detonated a pulse wave torpedo at the coordinates of the tear. <br>
DAX: Five minutes after they did, the rupture expanded radically. <br>
O'BRIEN: They were wiped out, along with the entire Hanoli system. <br>
KIRA: What happened to the rupture after that? it's not still there? <br>
DAX: It reached a critical mass point and imploded and then disappeared
from normal space altogether. <br>
SISKO: Were there any reports from the Vulcans about hallucinations on
board? Anything similar to what we're experiencing? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, sir. But they were only within range of the anomaly for
twelve hours. <br>
BASHIR: And Vulcans don't have the most active imaginations. <br>
SISKO: Were there any explanations offered for the initial cause of the
rupture? <br>
DAX: Dozens. Nothing confirmed. But we do know there were no wormholes
and very little starship activity in the area before it formed. <br>
O'BRIEN: We've looked high and low for some common ground, something to
give us a fix on how to attack this thing. And frankly, sir, as funny
as it sounds, we think pulse wave torpedoes may still be the best
approach. <br>
KIRA: Wait a minute. If it didn't work very well last time, why <br>
O'BRIEN: The Vulcans were using a primitive device. In the past two
hundred years, we've developed far better ways of controlling the flux
density. We should be able to contain the internal reaction this time. <br>
KIRA: And if we can't, we destroy the whole Bajoran system. <br>
SISKO: Major, the rupture is already expanding. We have to seal it or
it's going to destroy this system anyway. <br>
DAX: The smaller it is, the better chance we have. <br>
SISKO: How long will it take to create one of these torpedoes? <br>
O'BRIEN: We could have one ready by twenty two hundred hours. <br>
SISKO: If the rift expands at all before imploding, we have to be
prepared. Route auxiliary power to shields. Major, I'd like you to
coordinate evacuation of the pylons. Odo can help you. Dismissed. </font></p>

immediately. <br>

collapse. <br>
SISKO: Chief? <br>

may be neutralising the pulse waves. Stand by. <br>

traces of the rupture? <br>

whole thing out. <br>
SISKO: And if I remember correctly, you said that your previous scans
hadn't picked up any anomalies at all. <br>
DAX: I thought that whatever was out there was too small for the
scanners to identify. <br>
SISKO: So you imagined that we had a subspace rupture, and that's
exactly what it turned out to be. <br>
DAX: That is what I imagined. <br>
SISKO: And once you learned about the rift that destroyed the Hanoli
system, we all imagined that we might have another just like it. Mister
O'Brien, drop the shields. <br>

KIRA: None of this makes any sense. I mean, why did they appear in the
first place? <br>
DAX: It might still be related to the elevated thoron emissions in the
plasma field. The readings still haven't returned to normal. <br>
SISKO: Continue your analysis, Dax, but this time no speculations, just
facts. <br>
DAX: Yes, Benjamin. <br>
