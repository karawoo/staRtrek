KIRA: The Rotarran and the Koraga were ambushed by a Dominion patrol
near the Badlands. <br>
EZRI: Worf was commanding the Koraga. <br>
KIRA: It didn't make it. <br>
SISKO: Let's get married. <br>
KASIDY: Do you mean it? <br>
SISKO: I love you. <br>
DAMAR: Does Weyoun know you're here? <br>
DUKAT: I see he still has you under his thumb. <br>
KIRA: We have a problem. It's Ezri. There's a runabout missing. <br>
O'BRIEN: She must've gotten it into her head to go looking for Worf. <br>
EZRI: They're coming in behind us. <br>
(The Jem'Hadar shoot Ezri and Worf down.) <br>
FOUNDER: The vaccine. How is it progressing? <br>
WEYOUN: I regret that it failed to stabilise the latest sample you
provided. <br>
EZRI: I can't believe I'm stuck here with you. <br>
WORF: Perhaps you would rather be on the station with Captain Boday. <br>
DUKAT: That surgeon you recommended does excellent work. What do you
think? <br>
(Worf and Ezri are captured by the Breen.) <br>
SARAH: Your path is a difficult one. She can not share it with you. <br>
SISKO: I want to spend my life with her. <br>
SARAH: If you do, you will know nothing but sorrow. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAKE: Did they tell you why you can't marry Kasidy?
<br>
SISKO: The Prophets didn't say that I can't, they just said that I
shouldn't. <br>
JAKE: It's the same thing. I don't see why it's any of their business. <br>
SISKO: Everything I do is their business. <br>
JAKE: Have you told Kasidy? <br>
SISKO: No, she's on a cargo run. She won't be back for a couple of
days. <br>
JAKE: And when she gets back, what are you going to tell her? That some
Prophet who says that she's your mother, Sarah, told you not to marry
her? <br>
SISKO: Jake, you're not making me feel better. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Captain Sisko, Kai Winn is here to see you. <br>
SISKO: Send her in. We'll talk later. <br>
(Jake leaves by a corridor door, Winn and her entourage enter.) <br>
WINN: Emissary, congratulations. <br>
SISKO: Eminence. <br>
WINN: I'm so happy for you. This wedding is a momentous event for
Bajor. I want to be sure the proceedings reflect its importance, so
I've come to assist in the preparations. <br>
SISKO: That's very kind of you, but I'm not sure that it's necessary. <br>
WINN: Well, you don't have to thank me. I'm glad to do it. I understand
you've asked Vedek Telna to perform the ceremony. Perhaps you thought I
would be unavailable, but since I'm here, I think you'll agree that it
would be more appropriate for me to do it. I'll talk to Vedek Telna,
and I'm sure he'd be willing to step aside. Well, these are joyful days
indeed. You've given the Prophets reason to smile. Is there something
wrong, Emissary? You seem troubled. <br>
SISKO: The Prophets came to me in a vision. <br>
WINN: I see. <br>
SISKO: They warned me that I was going to have to face a great trial. <br>
WINN: Did they say what it would be? <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid not. The Prophets don't always make themselves clear.
<br>
WINN: I wouldn't know, as they've never spoken to me directly. In any
case, you have always been willing to do whatever it is they ask. Well,
I pray that they'll give you the strength to face your trial. I sense
you're going to need it. Emissary. <br>
SISKO: Eminence.

WINN: Solbor? <br>
KIRA: She will serve us well. <br>
(Sisko is standing there too.) <br>
WINN: Prophets. (she kneels) I have waited so long for you to speak to
me. How can I serve you? <br>
SISKO: The Sisko has faltered. You must bring the Restoration. <br>
WINN: The Restoration? <br>
SOLBOR: Bajor's fate rests with you. <br>
WINN: Tell me what to do. <br>
KIRA: The Guide will reveal the way. <br>
WINN: What Guide? <br>
SISKO: He will come to you. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: They will be feeding us soon. If we could
position ourselves on both sides of the door, we might be able to
disarm the first Breen that comes through. <br>
EZRI: Worf, face it. The 'guard, my cellmate is ill' trick didn't work.
Neither did your 'I'll make a tool and short circuit the door' idea. <br>
WORF: We must not give up. The first duty of every captured officer is
to attempt escape. <br>
(The door opens. The first Breen points a weapon at Worf, the second
throws tins to the pair.)
EZRI: What's the special today? (she looks in the tin) Algae paste. My
favourite. <br>
(The Breen leave.) <br>
EZRI: I wonder what the Breen look like under those helmets? <br>
WORF: They say no one has ever seen one and lived to speak of it. <br>
EZRI: Maybe they're all furry. It's supposed to be very cold on Breen. <br>
WORF: One thing is certain. <br>
EZRI: They're horrible cooks? <br>
WORF: They are dangerous. They do not tolerate incursions into their
space. During the Second Empire, Chancellor Mow'ga sent a fleet of
Klingon ships to conquer their homeworld, and they were never heard
from again. We have been travelling for three days. We could be in
Breen space by now. <br>
EZRI: Well, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that they saw our
shuttle crash and decided to take us back to Deep Space Nine. <br>
WORF: You are being humourous. <br>
EZRI: Not very, I guess. <br>
WORF: Jadzia also used humour to lift her spirits. <br>
EZRI: You didn't laugh very much at her jokes, either. <br>
WORF: You are a lot like her. <br>
EZRI: In some ways. <br>
WORF: I thought that I had lost her forever, but you and I will have
many years together.

(Damar suddenly wakes.) <br>
DAMAR: What are you doing here? <br>
WEYOUN: Since you're ignoring your comm. system, I decided to wake you
myself. <br>
DAMAR: I worked late last night. <br>
WEYOUN: Yes, I can see that. Get yourself cleaned up. We're leaving
this afternoon. <br>
DAMAR: Where are we going? <br>
WEYOUN: You needn't concern yourself with that. <br>
DAMAR: Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. <br>
WEYOUN: You mean your business with Dukat? Did you really think I
didn't know he was here? Masquerading as a Bajoran. What's he up to
this time? <br>
DAMAR: He wouldn't say. <br>
WEYOUN: Yet you helped him all the same. Such loyalty. It would be
impressive if it wasn't so misplaced. <br>

himself in a mirror. He has to turn away before he can drink.)

DAMAR: And your identity documents. <br>
DUKAT: Good I knew I could count on you. You don't look well. <br>
DAMAR: I'm fine. <br>
DUKAT: What happened to that brave officer I served with? The one who
stood at my side while we fought the entire Klingon Empire with a
single ship? <br>
DAMAR: Those were simpler times. <br>
DUKAT: Those days might be gone, but the man I served with isn't. He's
still within you. Reach in and grab hold of him, Damar. Cardassia needs
a leader. <br>
DAMAR: You were its leader once. You could be again. <br>
DUKAT: The Pah wraiths have shown me that I have different destiny.
Good luck, old friend. <br>

KASIDY: Bajorans consider it good luck for a bride to wear a Navatan
shawl. What's the matter? You don't like it? <br>
SISKO: It's lovely. <br>
KASIDY: Then why the long face? <br>
SISKO: We need to talk. <br>
KASIDY: Why do I have the feeling I'm not going to like this? <br>
SISKO: There's something I haven't told you. A few days ago, one of the
Prophets came to me in a vision. It was Sarah. <br>
KASIDY: Your mother? What did she want? <br>
SISKO: She said the path that I was meant to walk is for me alone. That
you can't walk it with me. <br>
KASIDY: Why? <br>
SISKO: She said I would know nothing but sorrow if I ignored her
warning. <br>
KASIDY: That almost sounds like a threat. <br>
SISKO: No, it wasn't anything like that. She was worried for me. Like a
mother would be. <br>
KASIDY: What are you going to do? <br>
SISKO: Kasidy, the Prophets see things that we can't. If she was that
concerned, it must be for a good reason. <br>
KASIDY: You're not answering my question. <br>
SISKO: Kasidy, I love you and I want to be with you. <br>
KASIDY: Then be with me, Ben. <br>
SISKO: I can't. I can't go against the Prophets. (she gives him the
shawl.) Kasidy, please, try and understand. <br>

WORF: Ezri! <br>
EZRI: No! <br>
(She wakes.) <br>
WORF: It is all right. You were having a bad dream. <br>
EZRI: Where are we? <br>
WORF: We're still aboard the Breen ship. <br>
EZRI: They were chasing me in an ice cave. I was so cold I could barely
breathe. <br>
WORF: Shh. It is over now. <br>
EZRI: I couldn't get away from them. Every time I looked back they were
right behind me. And then one of them grabbed me with this huge claw. <br>
WORF: The Breen do not have claws. <br>
EZRI: How do you know? Besides, it was a dream. Dreams are full of
things that don't make sense. <br>
WORF: That is why it is best to ignore them. <br>
EZRI: How can you say that? Dreams contain valuable insights. Things
that don't seem to make sense are actually the key to what your
unconscious is trying to tell you. Anyway, I got away from him, but
there was nowhere to run. And just when I thought he was about to kill
me, he reached up and took off his helmet. <br>
WORF: And? <br>
EZRI: And it was Julian. <br>
WORF: Doctor Bashir? <br>
EZRI: Isn't that strange? I wonder what it meant? <br>
WORF: Doctor Bashir is a Breen. <br>
EZRI: Very funny. The cave could symbolise the womb. Maybe my
subconscious is trying to tell me that I need to confront emotions that
I've repressed since birth. But which one? I've been born nine times. <br>
WORF: This is ridiculous. <br>
EZRI: I'm a counsellor. Analysing dreams is part of my job. <br>
WORF: Jadzia never talked about her dreams. <br>
EZRI: Well, I'm not Jadzia, am I? <br>
(Three Breen enter. Once keeps Ezri back and the other two go for Worf.
He refuses to move so they jab him with their electric shock weapons
and he collapses. Ezri gets jabbed as well. They drag Worf away.) <br>

WINN: Your pagh is strong, Anjohl. I've been waiting for you. <br>

DUKAT: Thank you. <br>
WINN: Tell me about yourself, Anjohl. You came here to pray for
prosperity. Have things been difficult for you? <br>
(Solbor leaves.) <br>
DUKAT: Yes. Rogath blight destroyed my entire crop last year. <br>
WINN: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. <br>
DUKAT: Most of the farms in Relliketh fell victim to it. <br>
WINN: And the land shall be poisoned by a great evil. It's from the
ancient texts. Talnot's Prophecy of the Final Days. <br>
DUKAT: I see. <br>
WINN: Well, tell me more about this blight. <br>
DUKAT: Unfortunately the only way to eradicate it is to burn your
fields at the first sign of contamination. <br>
WINN: Go on. <br>
DUKAT: Then you must let your land lie fallow for a whole season to
allow for the restoration of the soil. <br>
WINN: Restoration? <br>
DUKAT: The following year, the fields will be fertile again. <br>
WINN: The poison must be purged away so the land can be reborn. <br>
DUKAT: Eminence? <br>
WINN: Do you pray to the Prophets, Anjohl? <br>
DUKAT: Every day. <br>
WINN: And have they ever answered you, in a vision, or in your dreams? <br>
DUKAT: Oh, there have been times when I've thought I could feel their
presence. But spoken to me? No. Surely they'd reserve such a blessing
for someone like you. <br>
WINN: You are right. They have spoken to me, and they told me they were
going to send you here. <br>
DUKAT: Me? <br>
WINN: You've been blessed, Anjohl. They've anointed you to be my guide.
<br>
DUKAT: I don't understand. <br>
WINN: You are to help me bring about the Restoration of Bajor. <br>
DUKAT: But surely the Prophets would have chosen someone more worthy
than I? <br>
WINN: You should have more faith in yourself, Anjohl. And in the
Prophets. <br>
DUKAT: Of course. <br>
WINN: But rest assured, they'll reveal what they want from us, and
together we will walk the path they've laid out. </font></p>

wouldn't ask you to do something like that without a reason. <br>
SISKO: You would think they would tell me what it is. <br>
KIRA: It doesn't work like that, and you know that. Well, what they're
asking you to do isn't easy, but they've never led you down the wrong
path. <br>
SISKO: Not so far. There's always a first time. To them I'm The Sisko,
an instrument to carry out their
wishes, but they forget that I am also human, with dreams and wishes of
my own. They say that marrying Kasidy is a mistake. Maybe it is, but
it's my mistake to make. <br>

WINN: More springwine? <br>
DUKAT: Yes. It's extraordinary. I've never tasted anything like this. <br>
WINN: It's a rare vintage from before the occupation. I was going to
give this bottle to the Emissary as a wedding gift. <br>
DUKAT: Well, I'm honoured that you would choose to share it with me. <br>
WINN: Well, I doubt that he would have been able to appreciate it as
much, not being a Bajoran. <br>
DUKAT: I suppose not. The Prophets may have chosen to speak through
him, but he's not really one of us, is he? <br>
WINN: No. No, he isn't. <br>
DUKAT: There are times when I wonder if he truly understands our
people. Still, it's not for me to question why the Prophets chose him
as their Emissary. <br>
WINN: You forget the Prophets chose you to be my guide. You must speak
your mind freely, Anjohl. <br>
DUKAT: The Emissary didn't suffer through the occupation. He has no
idea what the Cardassians did to us. Those years left many scars on
Bajor's soul. So, how can he help heal what he could never comprehend? <br>
WINN: I have often asked myself the same question. <br>
DUKAT: I survived the occupation purely by chance. <br>
WINN: Tell me. When the Resistance destroyed the Cardassian outpost in
Relliketh, Gul Dukat ordered a hundred Bajorans rounded up. His
intention was to send us to the capital for public execution. <br>
WINN: A hundred from Relliketh. When did that occur? <br>
DUKAT: Just before the great famine. By sheer luck, my transport was
rerouted to a labour camp. I learned years later that the dispatcher
had misread the orders. <br>
WINN: His name was Prenar. And he didn't misread the orders. <br>
DUKAT: How could you know that? <br>
WINN: I was a Ranjen at that time. I convinced the Vedek who led my
order that we needed to take a more active role in the Resistance. He
allowed me to remove some gemstones from our tabernacle. I used those
to bribe various Cardassians in exchange for some small acts of
leniency. Prenar was one of them. I paid him to reroute the transport
from Relliketh. <br>

QUARK: Terellian diamonds aren't that easy to come by, especially with
this war on. Needless to say, it was non-refundable. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Quark. <br>
QUARK: It seems a shame to let something so beautiful go to waste. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ezri is thrown back in. Like Worf before, she is
rambling as if in a nightmare.) <br>
EZRI: I'm going to help you through this, Garak. I'm not just saying
this because I'm your sister. You have a gift. No more algae paste. I'm
not like you. I'm not like you, Joran, I'm not a murderer. <br>
WORF: Shh. It's all right. <br>
EZRI: I was your wife. Why don't you talk to me? I love you. Kiss me.
Kiss me, Julian. </font></p>

WINN: Yes? <br>
SOLBOR [OC]: Forgive me for disturbing you at this hour, Eminence, but
Anjohl is here and he insists on seeing you. <br>
WINN: I'll be right there.

WINN: It's all right. You may go, Solbor. <br>
SOLBOR: As you wish. <br>
(Solbor leaves.) <br>
DUKAT: Something wondrous has happened. I talked with my brother in
Relliketh. He told me that this morning, when he went out to inspect
the fields, he found moba saplings sprouting from the soil. But it's
impossible. We only planted last week. Tell me, could it be a sign? <br>
WINN: Yes, it is a sign. A sign from the Prophets. They're telling you
that your farm will thrive under your brother's care. They don't want
you to go back to Relliketh. They want you at my side. <br>
DUKAT: Then this is where I'll stay, Eminence. <br>
WINN: Adami. <br>
DUKAT: Adami. What a beautiful name. <br>
WINN: It's all right. The Prophets brought us together. <br>
(So they kiss.)

the final departure check. <br>
MAN: Yes, ma'am. <br>
(Kasidy picks up her bag, then Sisko enters.) <br>
SISKO: I made a mistake. I don't care what the Prophets want. I want to
marry you. We'll worry about the rest later. <br>
KASIDY: Ben, don't do this to me, not if you're going to change your
mind again. <br>
SISKO: I won't. I love you. Okay, let's go. <br>
KASIDY: Where? <br>
SISKO: Where do you think?

comfy chairs. O'Brien is by the table. Quark is setting out a tray of
champagne glasses. Jake, Sisko and Admiral Ross are at the far end.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Didn't think you were going to make it. <br>
BASHIR: I only heard about it twenty minutes ago. <br>
QUARK: Me, too and I'm the caterer. I can't work under these
conditions. <br>
BASHIR: Too bad Ezri and Worf couldn't be here. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, they probably got held up picking out a wedding gift. <br>
(Quark hands round the glasses. Kira refuses.) <br>
QUARK: Something for you, Nog? <br>
ODO: Usually, when we come to events like this, you're the one who has
to remind me to smile. I wonder why they decided not to have a Bajoran
ceremony? I hope the Prophets forgive them. <br>
KIRA: So do I. <br>
(Nog pipes the bride aboard.) <br>
JAKE: You look beautiful. <br>
KASIDY: Thank you. <br>
ODO: Well done, Nog. <br>
NOG: Considering I only had a few minutes to practise. <br>
ROSS: One of the most pleasant duties of a senior officer is the
privilege of joining two people together in matrimony. Today I have the
honour to unite Kasidy Danielle Yates and Benjamin Lafayette Sisko in
marriage. Kasidy, do you accept this man as your husband, to love and
cherish above all others, until death separates you? <br>
KASIDY: I do. <br>
ROSS: Benjamin, do you accept this woman as your wife, to love and
cherish her above all others, until death separates you? <br>
SISKO: I do. <br>
(Jake hands over the rings.) <br>
ROSS: These rings are a symbol your love for each other, and your
promise to abide by the vows you've made today. <br>
KASIDY: With this ring, I thee wed. <br>
SISKO: With this ring <br>

DAMAR: Were you? <br>
WEYOUN: I've kept you in the dark too long, Damar, and for that I
apologise. You are the leader of Cardassia and you deserve to know

EZRI: What is that supposed to mean? <br>
WORF: You dishonour me and yourself. <br>
EZRI: I must've missed something when I was gone. <br>
WORF: How long have you had these feelings for him? <br>
EZRI: For who? <br>
WORF: Doctor Bashir! <br>
EZRI: What? <br>
WORF: When the Breen brought you back, you spoke his name. <br>

WORF: Yes. You said that you loved him. <br>
EZRI: Julian? I said I loved with Julian? <br>
WORF: Do not try to deny it. <br>
EZRI: Worf, look, I admit that I find him to be charming. And obviously
he is an attractive man. But I'm not <br>
WORF: You are in love with him! <br>
EZRI: I am not! <br>
WORF: Then why do you dream about him? <br>
EZRI: You're the one that said dreams don't mean anything. <br>
WORF: I should have known. Jadzia had feelings for him as well. <br>
