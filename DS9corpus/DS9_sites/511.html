Captain's log, stardate 50485.2. I've come to Marva Four, a planet near
the Badlands, to rendezvous with an informer who claims to have
information on the whereabouts of the Maquis leader and former
Starfleet officer Michael Eddington. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Refugee camp]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A sorry bunch of people are living in a cave lit
by florescent tubes. Sisko enters in civilian clothes. <br>
SISKO: Looking for a friend of mine. His name is Cing'ta. <br>
(A man looks up from his welding and points to a curtained off area.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rough furniture but no person visible.) <br>
SISKO: Cing'ta? <br>
(Sisko reaches for his phaser, but a disrupter is put to his head.) <br>
EDDINGTON: Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Eddington. <br>
EDDINGTON: Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an
accident on the way to this rendezvous. <br>
SISKO: Is he dead? <br>
EDDINGTON: You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're
not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a
particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very
much alive. <br>
SISKO: How merciful. You condemned him to a slow death. <br>
EDDINGTON: It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to
you. He betrayed us. <br>
SISKO: Now there's a subject you know a lot about. <br>
EDDINGTON: You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're
face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? <br>
SISKO: I will say the rest at your court-martial. <br>
EDDINGTON: Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact
that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it
happened on your watch? <br>
SISKO: You didn't leave Starfleet. If you had, I wouldn't be here. You
betrayed Starfleet. You used your position as security chief to feed
the Maquis information about us. And at the same time, you misled us
with false information about them. There is a word for that. Treason. <br>
EDDINGTON: Look out there. <br>
(Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) <br>
EDDINGTON: Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had
farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the
Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the
Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight.
<br>
SISKO: It's not that simple and you know it. These people don't have to
live here like this. We've offered them resettlement. <br>
EDDINGTON: They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the
lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your
father's home to the Cardassians? <br>
SISKO: I'm not here to debate Federation policy with <br>
EDDINGTON: I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain.
They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything
away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform.
There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. <br>
SISKO: You know what I see out there, Mister Eddington? I see victims,
but not of Cardassia or the Federation. Victims of you, the Maquis. You
sold these people on the dream that one day they could go back to those
farms, and schools, and homes, but you know they never can. And the
longer you keep that hope alive, the longer these people will suffer.
Go ahead, shoot me. <br>
EDDINGTON: Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you
with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. <br>
(Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Defiant. Eddington just beamed out. Trace his
transporter signal. <br>
KIRA [OC]: We've got it, Captain. He's on a Maquis raider. They're
breaking orbit and heading out of the system. <br>
SISKO: Beam me aboard and lay in a pursuit course. All hands to battle
stations. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Aye, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: He's headed for the Badlands, all right.
Course is zero mark two one three. <br>
SISKO: Commander. <br>
DAX: Changing course now to zero mark two one three. We're on his tail,
Captain. <br>
SISKO: Maximum warp. How long until we're in firing range? <br>
WORF: Twenty two minutes. <br>
SISKO: Major? <br>
KIRA: Not good enough. He'll reach the plasma fields two minutes before
we're in range. <br>
SISKO: We need some help. What's the position of the starship Malinche?
<br>
WORF: They're on patrol in the DMZ, near the Gamma seven outpost. <br>
SISKO: Perfect. Is the new holo-communicator ready? <br>
KIRA: The Chief's had it online for six hours now. I think he's eager
to have someone give it a try. <br>
SISKO: Always like to please the Chief. Open a channel to Captain
Sanders on the Malinche. <br>
(A hologram of Sanders appears inside a marked area behind the
Captain's chair.) <br>
SANDERS: Are you receiving my image, Captain? <br>
SISKO: Yes. And you? <br>
SANDERS: You appear to be sitting on my bridge. It may take me a while
to get used to this. I'm not fond of uninvited guests. <br>
SISKO: I'll try not to overstay my welcome but at the moment I need
your help. We're in pursuit of a Maquis raider headed for the Badlands.
Can you intercept? <br>
SANDERS: You seem pretty eager, Captain. What did this Maquis raider
do? <br>
SISKO: It's not what they did, it's who's in command. Michael
Eddington. <br>
SANDERS: Everyone's favourite traitor. <br>
SISKO: Captain, if you don't mind. <br>
SANDERS: You want him in your brig. We'll cut him off, you can grab
him. Sanders out. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
KIRA: The Malinche is moving to intercept. <br>
SISKO: Prepare to target the Maquis ship. I want to disable them but I
want them alive. <br>
WORF: Understood. <br>
SISKO: Send a security detachment to the Transporter room. Have them
prepared to receive prisoners. <br>
DAX: Captain, Eddington's dropped out of warp. <br>
SISKO: Go to impulse. Raise shields. <br>
KIRA: What is he doing? <br>
DAX: He's changed course. Now he's headed directly for us. <br>
WORF: He has locked his weapons on us. <br>
KIRA: He's no match for the Defiant. Is this some kind of suicide run? <br>
SISKO: Not Eddington. He's up to something. Let's not give him a chance
to make his move. Mister Worf, fire phasers. <br>
(And everything shuts down.) <br>
SISKO: Report. <br>
KIRA: We've got a massive computer failure. Every computer system is
down. And all the backups. We're losing control over everything. <br>
DAX: Weapons, navigation, helm, propulsion. <br>
SISKO: Bridge to Engine room. Commander, get down there. Find out
what's going on. <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>
SISKO: Try to route the auxiliary controls through the <br>
(A hologram appears) <br>
EDDINGTON: Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to
restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't.
You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have
to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we
were able to procure one. <br>
SISKO: You left a cascade virus in the Defiant's computers. <br>
EDDINGTON: Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great
deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief
O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. <br>
SISKO: I'll add it to the list of charges against you. <br>
EDDINGTON: Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add
this. <br>
(And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) <br>
EDDINGTON: You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this
personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity,
no harsh feelings toward you. <br>
SISKO: I wish I could say the same. <br>
EDDINGTON: Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew,
on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? <br>
SISKO: I don't need any lectures about Starfleet from you. And no
matter what happens here today it's not over between us. <br>
EDDINGTON: I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is
defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said,
the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not
you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. <br>
SISKO: Am I supposed to thank you? <br>
EDDINGTON: No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike
you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about
that on your long trip home.

returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: We've got our work cut out for us.
Eddington's cascade virus disabled every memory circuit on the Defiant.
We have to reload and reprogramme the entire database. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: How long? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, if we were at a shipyard with a spacedock and a crew <br>
SISKO: We're not. How long? <br>
O'BRIEN: Two weeks. And that's working with three shifts round the
clock. <br>
SISKO: Get started. If there's any way you can speed things up. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll do what I can. <br>
(O'Brien leaves) <br>
ODO: I've removed two similar cascade viruses hidden on the station's
main computer. By transmitting a signal, Eddington could have disabled
our entire defence system. <br>
SISKO: How long until you've eliminated all of Eddington's handiwork? <br>
ODO: It's a good question. I can't guarantee we've found all of them.
Eddington was DS9's chief of Starfleet security for eighteen months. He
had the opportunity to infiltrate and compromise every system on the
station. <br>
SISKO: Then check every system on the station. <br>
ODO: I intend to. Sir, have you ever reminded Starfleet command that
they stationed Eddington here because they didn't trust me? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
ODO: Please do. <br>
(Odo leaves.) <br>
SISKO: What word do you have from Starfleet Intelligence? <br>
WORF: Two Bolian freighters have disappeared near the Badlands. They
believe the Maquis are responsible. <br>
SISKO: What were the freighters carrying? <br>
WORF: Several thousand tons of selenium and rhodium nitrite. <br>
SISKO: That's not very valuable cargo. What would they want with it? <br>
WORF: Commander Dax is analysing the possibilities. <br>
SISKO: Good. In the meantime, help Chief O'Brien get the Defiant back
online. I want to get out there as soon as possible. <br>
(Sisko gestures Sanders to come in) <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>
SISKO: What can I do for you, Captain? <br>
SANDERS: I don't know quite how to tell you this so I'll just say it.
Starfleet Command has given me a new assignment. They want me to bring
in Eddington. <br>
SISKO: Oh, you mean you've been ordered to help me bring him in, don't
you? <br>
SANDERS: No. Your mission orders have changed. Eddington is no longer
your responsibility. <br>
SISKO: Did they give you a reason? <br>
SANDERS: You've been after him for eight months. Not to put too fine a
point on it, but you haven't gotten the job done. Look, Captain, I
understand how you feel. If one of my officers had fooled me the way
Eddington fooled you, I'd take it personally, too. Bad choice of words,
I didn't mean fooled. <br>
SISKO: No, you're exactly right. I was fooled. But it won't happen
again. <br>
SANDERS: That's not the issue. Starfleet also believes that where
Eddington is concerned, you're vulnerable. He just knows you too well,
Captain. So maybe it's time for someone he doesn't know to go after
him. <br>
SISKO: Good hunting. <br>
SANDERS: Thank you, Captain.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko is taking his frustration out on a punch
bag.) <br>
DAX: The good news is Starfleet Intelligence is making progress
breaking the Maquis communication codes. <br>
SISKO: The bad news is it won't do us any good. We're out of the game.
But what the hell, right? You win some, you lose some. <br>
DAX: You always had problems with the lose some part of that. <br>
SISKO: What can I say, old man? In twenty five years of duty, I have
never been taken off an assignment until now. <br>
DAX: Right. This is about being taken off the assignment. It has
nothing to do with a certain ex-security officer we both know. <br>
SISKO: He worked under me for a year and a half. I saw him almost every
day, read his reports, had him for dinner. I even took him to a
baseball game in the holosuite once. And I never saw it. It's my job to
be a good judge of character and what did I do? Not only did I not see
it, I put him up for a promotion. <br>
DAX: He played his hand well. <br>
SISKO: He played me all right, and what is my excuse? Is he a
changeling? No. Is he a being with seven lifetimes of experience? No.
Is he a wormhole alien? No. He's just a man, like me. And he beat me! <br>
DAX: It's good. <br>
SISKO: Good? <br>
DAX: It's good you're working it out on the bag, Benjamin. Because
you're going to have to let go of this one. Eddington is someone else's
problem now, and you're going to have to live with that. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Ops to Captain Sisko. <br>
SISKO: What is it, Major? <br>
KIRA [OC]: Sir, you'd better get up here. There's news and it's about
Eddington.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Report. <br>
KIRA: Eddington just upped the ante. He attacked the Cardassian colony
on Veloz Prime with a biogenic weapon. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
WORF: He launched three stratospheric torpedoes at the planet and
spread cobalt diselenide throughout the biosphere. <br>
DAX: A nerve agent that is harmless to most humanoids but it is deadly
to Cardassians. <br>
WORF: The Cardassians are already evacuating. And Eddington has
announced that the Maquis intend to reclaim the planet once they are
gone. <br>
KIRA: What I don't understand is where the Maquis got the materials to
make a biogenic weapon. <br>
DAX: I do. I should've seen it earlier. The selenium and rhodium
nitrites they hijacked can be reformulated, and with some work,
synthesised to produce cobalt diselenide. <br>
SISKO: Where's the Malinche? <br>
KIRA: On the other side of the Badlands. They're headed for Veloz Prime
now, but by the time they get there. <br>
SISKO: Eddington will be long gone. <br>
KIRA: Given the amount of chemical compounds Eddington stole, how many
of these weapons will he be able to make? <br>
SISKO: Enough to poison every Cardassian colony in the DMZ. <br>
DAX: There must be something we can do. Worf, are there any other
starships near Veloz Prime? <br>
WORF: The Malinche is our only ship in the sector. <br>
KIRA: So unless they stop Eddington, the Maquis have turned the tide. <br>
SISKO: There is another ship in the area. It's moored at docking bay
three. <br>
(They all step onto the turbolift.) <br>
SISKO: Defiant.

half the systems are back online and most of those are not operating at
full capacity. <br>
SISKO: What about the warp drive? <br>
O'BRIEN: We can go to warp six, but the inertial dampers haven't been
fully repaired so don't expect a smooth ride. <br>
DAX: The weapons are also online but the targeting scanners have to be
manually calibrated. We can shoot, but God knows what we'll hit. <br>
SISKO: What about communications? <br>
O'BRIEN: The Defiant's comm. system is fried. And I do mean fried. <br>
DAX: Well, we still have our comm. badges. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm afraid not. They won't work either, not with all the
interference from the unshielded EPS conduits. <br>
DAX: Well, what do we use? Cups and a long string? <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll have to improvise. Let me introduce you to your new
comm. system. Cadet. <br>
NOG: Cadet Nog, reporting as ordered, sir. <br>
SISKO: Stand easy. <br>
O'BRIEN: With most of the bridge control functions offline, all orders
to Engineering have to be relayed. In the interests of clarity I
thought it best that those messages be relayed with one voice, Mister
Academy here. I figured you'd want someone who could hear you while the
bridge is exploding all around you. <br>
NOG: Exploding? <br>
SISKO: We may be going into a combat situation. Do think you're ready
for that, Cadet? <br>
NOG: Sir. Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad to hear it. Report to the bridge. <br>
NOG: Aye, sir. (as he leaves) Exploding? <br>
O'BRIEN: Let me give you all the bad news at once, sir. We have no
cloak, no transporters, no replicators, and the stabilising gyros are
at only fifty percent. So don't ask for any sharp turns, unless you
want to end up doing barrel rolls. <br>
DAX: That could be fun. <br>
SISKO: Do you have any good news, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: The new holo-communicator I installed it works perfectly. <br>

DAX: What? <br>
SISKO: That I have lost all perspective. That I'm turning this into a
vendetta between me and Eddington, and that I'm putting the ship, the
crew and my entire career at risk, and if I had any brains at all I'd
go back to my office, sit down and read Odo's crime reports. <br>
DAX: I wasn't going to say that. <br>
SISKO: But that's what you were thinking, right? <br>
DAX: No. Actually, what I was thinking is, you're becoming more like
Curzon all the time. <br>
SISKO: I don't know how to take that. <br>
DAX: Consider it a compliment. And the next time I go off half-cocked
on some wild-eyed adventure, think back to this moment and be a little
more understanding.

who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread.
Sound like anyone you know? <br>
SISKO: Why don't you beam over and we'll discuss it. <br>
KIRA: Captain, closing on the Maquis ship. Seven hundred kilometres. <br>
SISKO: Ready weapons. <br>
WORF: Phaser banks charged. <br>
SISKO: Lock target. <br>
WORF: Locked. <br>
SISKO: It's over, Eddington. Why don't you surrender your vessel and
prepare to be boarded. <br>
EDDINGTON: It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the
book. <br>
(Transmission ends) <br>
KIRA: Sir, the neutrino readings are dissipating. It's not a ship. It's
an unmanned probe set to transmit a false warp signature. <br>
SISKO: He wanted to lure us here. Why? <br>
KIRA: He's up to something outside the plasma fields. <br>
SISKO: Helm, bring us about. Get us out of here. Engines at full
impulse. <br>
NOG: Engine Room, bridge. Engines to full impulse. <br>
DAX: Hard to port. Full thrusters. Course one eight zero mark zero. <br>
NOG: Sir, Chief O'Brien doesn't recommend increasing velocity through
the plasma fields. <br>
SISKO: Objection noted. Now get me more speed! <br>
NOG: Engine Room, bridge. More speed. <br>
(Out of the plasma streams into clear space) <br>
KIRA: Sir, picking up a distress call. It's the starship Malinche.
They've been ambushed by the Maquis. It's dead in space. <br>
(Later, at the Malinche, Sanders' hologram has definitely been in the
wars. ) <br>
SISKO: How can we help you, Captain? <br>
SANDERS: Our warp core matrix compositor is fused, our navigational
systems are disabled. If you could spare some micro-power relays, we
should have the engines back online in a day or two. <br>
SISKO: Engine room, beam a damage control team to the Malinche. Tell
them to take along a dozen micro-power relays. <br>
SANDERS: Wee got a distress signal from a Cardassian freighter. <br>
NOG: (underneath) Engine Room, bridge. Transport a damage control team
to the Malinche with twelve micro-power relays. <br>
SANDERS: They'd just been attacked by the Maquis. Suffered some
casualties. Our sensors confirmed what we were being told, but when we
lowered our shields to transport the wounded <br>
SISKO: The sensor readings had been faked. <br>
SANDERS: There were no Cardassians on that freighter. The Maquis had
rigged it with a focused particle beam that punched through our gyro
shielding and we lost helm control, and by the time we got back on our
feet again, three Maquis raiders came out from the plasma field. Well,
it seems I couldn't get the job done either, Captain. <br>
SISKO: It's not over. <br>
SANDERS: I figured you'd be going after him. We have something that
might be useful to you. We intercepted a coded message from one of
Eddington's raiders. Maybe you can decode it. Our computers are still
down. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate it. <br>
SANDERS: Do me a favour? <br>
SISKO: Of course. <br>
SANDERS: Save me a seat at his court-martial. <br>
SISKO: Count on it. <br>
SANDERS: Good hunting, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. With the Defiant's
computers still not fully operational, we're relying on Odo back at
Deep Space Nine, to decipher the Maquis message. In the meantime, we're
combing the DMZ in the hopes of a chance encounter with Eddington. But
with each passing hour, our hopes are fading.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Sir, incoming transmission. It's Odo. <br>
ODO: (hologram) Captain. <br>
SISKO: Odo, we need some good news around here. Tell me that you have
some. <br>
ODO: Possibly. I've analysed the Maquis message. <br>
SISKO: And? <br>
ODO: It appears to be a simple Breen nursery rhyme. A heterophonic,
five line verse. Quite a catchy one, too. <br>
(Odo plays the song.) <br>
SISKO: What's it mean? <br>
ODO: Metrical analysis shows an alternating tetrameter and pentameter
structure, but the computer could find no meaningful pattern in the
words. They appear to be just what they are, nonsensical phrases strung
together because they rhyme. At least, to the Breen. <br>
SISKO: And the music? <br>
ODO: It's written on a Lyxian scale. I ran it through the computer too.
No meaningful pattern. <br>
SISKO: So we're nowhere? <br>
ODO: I wouldn't say that. You see, I remembered something that
Eddington once said to me. The best place to hide something is in plain
sight. And since this is a Breen nursery rhyme <br>
SISKO: So you think that Eddington is using the music as a signal for a
rendezvous in the Breen system? <br>
ODO: Or a Breen settlement like the one on Portas Five, which isn't far
from the DMZ. The biogenic components of the weapons Eddington's been
using are very bulky and very unstable. They need to be kept in a
large, sophisticated cold storage unit. <br>
SISKO: And if anyone knows how to keep things cold, it's the Breen.
Thank you, Odo. <br>
ODO: Captain. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf, do we have a series of sensor relays near Portas
Five? <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. Two class five intelligence drones. <br>
SISKO: Pull their sensor logs. I want to see who's been visiting the
Breen system.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Odo's hunch has proven
accurate. Our intelligence drones detected a Maquis freighter entering
Portas Five three hours ago. The freighter was last seen headed into
the Dorvan sector of the DMZ. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: Considering the freighter's range, velocity,
and heading Eddington's next target is one of four Cardassian colonies.
But these targets are unlikely. <br>
WORF: Their defence systems were recently upgraded by the Cardassians. <br>
SISKO: Eddington isn't looking for a fight. That leaves only Quatal and
Panora. <br>
WORF: Quatal has a lucrative mining operation and their weapon systems
are in the process of being upgraded, but they're not fully
operational. <br>
SISKO: A tempting target. <br>
DAX: Not as tempting as Panora. The Maquis attacked them two months ago
and most of their defence systems were severely damaged. They're almost
helpless. <br>
KIRA: And there are constant ion storms in that system. Good places to
hide if you want to mount a surprise attack. <br>
WORF: A tactic Eddington knows well. Panora is a more logical target
than Quatal. <br>
SISKO: Then Eddington will attack Quatal. <br>
WORF: Sir? <br>
SISKO: He likes being unpredictable. <br>
(Later) <br>
DAX: Approaching Quatal Prime <br>
SISKO: Slow to impulse power. Full scan. <br>
NOG: Engine Room, bridge. Slow to impulse. <br>
KIRA: Activate parabolic sensor array. Initiate lateral scanners. We're
too late, Captain. Eddington's detonated his weapon. The nerve agent is
already spreading through the planet's atmosphere. <br>
DAX: Which means the Cardassians don't have much time to get away.
Eddington's always one step ahead of us. <br>
KIRA: Maybe not this time. I'm reading residual neutrino levels. Looks
like one maybe two Maquis raiders behind the fourth moon. They're on
the run. <br>
SISKO: Go after them. Full impulse. <br>
NOG: Engine Room, Bridge. Full impulse. <br>
DAX: Onscreen. Shields up. Charge phaser banks. <br>
CREWWOMAN: Aye, sir. <br>
(Two raiders appear on the viewscreen.) <br>
SISKO: How long to intercept? <br>
KIRA: Fifteen seconds. <br>
SISKO: Prepare to lock targets. <br>
WORF: Targeting sequence online. <br>
(The two ships split up.) <br>
SISKO: Hard to port. Stick with this one, old man. <br>
DAX: Full power to aft thrusters. <br>
KIRA: They've locked phasers on us. <br>
SISKO: Power to forward shields. <br>
KIRA: Forward shields online. <br>
WORF: At maximum. <br>
(BOOM) <br>
DAX: Restabilise port and starboard <br>
SISKO: Lock target. <br>
WORF: Targeting scanners synchronised. <br>
SISKO: Fire! <br>
(Ka-BOOM!) <br>
SISKO: Helm, bring us about. One more to go. <br>
KIRA: Sir, this one's making another run for the planet. I don't get
it. They've already poisoned the atmosphere. <br>
SISKO: More speed. <br>
NOG: Engine Room, bridge. More speed. <br>
KIRA: They've locked phasers on one of the transport ships evacuating
the Cardassians. <br>
(The Maquis fire.) <br>
KIRA: They've disabled the transport. It's losing power. It's going
down. <br>
SISKO: Can we beam the crew off? <br>
KIRA: We're out of transporter range. Incoming transmission. <br>
EDDINGTON: (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession
with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But,
if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all
those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is
yours. <br>
SISKO: How long do they have? <br>
KIRA: Two minutes to impact. <br>
EDDINGTON: Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get
back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. <br>
SISKO: Helm, bring us about. Prepare to engage tractor beam. <br>
WORF: Initialising tractor beam. Aligning induction field. <br>
CREWWOMAN: Alignment complete. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mess hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Miserable Sisko is reading a PADD.) <br>
DAX: We've towed the transport ship out of the planet's gravitational
pull. <br>
SISKO: Once our repair team is back onboard, release the tractor beam.
The Cardassians can limp their way home in a day or two. <br>
DAX: Les Miserables. <br>
SISKO: You know it? <br>
DAX: I can't stand Victor Hugo. I tried reading The Hunchback of Notre
Dame, but I couldn't get through it. It was so melodramatic and his
heroines are so two dimensional. <br>
SISKO: Eddington compares me to one of the characters, Inspector
Javert. A policeman who relentlessly pursues a man named Valjean,
guilty of a trivial offence, and in the end Javert's own inflexibility
destroys him. He commits suicide. <br>
DAX: You can't believe that description fits you. Eddington is just
trying to get under your skin. <br>
SISKO: He did that eight months ago. What strikes me about this book is
that Eddington said that it's one of his favourites. <br>
DAX: There's no accounting for taste. <br>
SISKO: Let's think about it. A Starfleet security officer is fascinated
by a nineteenth century French melodrama, and now he's a leader of the
Maquis, a resistance group fighting the noble battle against the evil
Cardassians. <br>
DAX: It sounds like he's living out his own fantasy. <br>
SISKO: Exactly. And you know what? Les Miserables isn't about the
policeman. It's about Valjean, the victim of a monstrous injustice who
spends his entire life helping people, making noble sacrifices for
others. That's how Eddington sees himself. He's Valjean, he's Robin
Hood, he's a romantic, dashing figure, fighting the good fight against
insurmountable odds. <br>
DAX: The secret life of Michael Eddington. How does it help us? <br>
SISKO: Eddington is the hero of his own story. That makes me the
villain. And what is it that every hero wants to do? <br>
DAX: Kill the bad guy. <br>
SISKO: That's part of it. Heroes only kill when they have to. Eddington
could have killed me back in the refugee camp or when he disabled the
Defiant, but in the best melodramas the villain creates a situation
where the hero is forced to sacrifice himself for the people, for the
cause. One final grand gesture. <br>
DAX: What are you getting at, Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: I think it's time for me to become the villain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Commander, prepare two quantum torpedoes.
Have engineering attach a cargo pod with two hundred kilograms of
trilithium to each torpedo. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir, but <br>
SISKO: But what? <br>
WORF: The extra mass of the cargo pods will make the torpedo less
effective. Maquis Raiders are small and manoeuvrable. <br>
SISKO: I'm not planning to fire at any ships, Mister Worf. Major, what
is the nearest Maquis colony. <br>
KIRA: Solosos Three. Less than an hour away. <br>
SISKO: Helm, set a course for Solosos Three. <br>
DAX: Aye, sir. <br>
SISKO: Major, I want you to send the following message on all Maquis
frequencies. To all the members of the Maquis resistance. This is
Captain Sisko of the USS Defiant. In response to the Maquis's use of
biogenic weapons in their recent attacks, I am about to take the
following action. In exactly one hour, I will detonate two quantum
torpedoes that will scatter trilithium resin in the atmosphere of
Solosos Three. I thereby will make the planet uninhabitable to all
human life for the next fifty years. I suggest evacuation plans begin
immediately. What are you waiting for, people? Carry out your orders. <br>
(Later, orbiting Solosos Three.) <br>
WORF: Set torpedo targets to fifty kilometres above ground level. <br>
CREWWOMAN: Aye, sir. <br>
WORF: Lock. Ready, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Time? <br>
KIRA: One minute left. And still no transport ship activity or any
other sign that they're beginning to evacuate. <br>
SISKO: Commander Worf, prepare to fire torpedoes on my mark. <br>
WORF: Detach safeties on torpedoes one and two. <br>
KIRA: Incoming message. It's Eddington. <br>
EDDINGTON: (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect
me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the
service, is going to poison an entire planet? <br>
SISKO: That's exactly what I'm going to do. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're bluffing. <br>
SISKO: Am I? Commander, launch torpedoes. Commander, I said launch
torpedoes! <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
(Two lights impact the atmosphere, and it starts turning yellow.) <br>
KIRA: The trilithium resin is dissipating throughout the biosphere. The
Maquis are scrambling their transport ships. They're starting to
evacuate. <br>
EDDINGTON: Do you realise what you've done? <br>
SISKO: I've only just begun. I'm going to eliminate every Maquis colony
in the DMZ. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people
into homeless refugees. <br>
SISKO: That's right. When you attacked the Malinche you proved one
thing, that the Maquis have become an intolerable threat to the
security of the Federation, and I am going intend to eliminate that
threat. <br>
EDDINGTON: But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled
and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. <br>
SISKO: You should have thought about that before you attacked a
Federation starship. <br>
(Sisko turns his back on the Eddington hologram) <br>
SISKO: Helm, lay in a course for Tracken Two, warp six. Commander,
prepare two more torpedoes. <br>
NOG: Engine Room, bridge. Warp six. <br>
DAX: Set course zero five zero mark one seven nine. <br>
WORF: Unlock safeties on torpedoes three and four. <br>
EDDINGTON: Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against
everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal
vendetta? <br>
SISKO: You betrayed your uniform! <br>
EDDINGTON: And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you
don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession
with me, look what it's cost you. <br>
SISKO: Major, shut that thing off! Commander Worf, prepare to launch
torpedoes! <br>
EDDINGTON: Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our
biogenic weapons. <br>
