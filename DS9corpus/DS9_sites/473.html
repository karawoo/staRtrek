KIRA: Computer, elapsed time? <br>
COMPUTER: Three hours, twenty-seven minutes. <br>
ODO: That's not good enough. If one of my people were loose on the
station for that long, there's no telling how much damage they could
do. <br>
SISKO: Schedule another surprise drill. If the Dominion tries to
infiltrate the station, I want to be ready for them. <br>
ODO: And remind everyone that next time they'd better sweep everything.
A changeling can be anything. A post, a pillar, even a patch of
reflective surfacing. <br>
O'BRIEN: We get the message, Constable. <br>
ODO: I hope so, Chief. Just remember that the Founders are even better

QUARK: Excuse me. If you're done scaring my customers away, I'd like to
open the bar. <br>
KIRA: Go right ahead. <br>
QUARK: Thank you. Constable, it just occurred to me that if I knew in
advance how just long it'll take them for to catch you during the next

SISKO: The Tholian ambassador owed me a favour. May I? <br>

SISKO: How far is Cestus Three? <br>
KASIDY: Eight weeks at maximum warp. <br>
SISKO: To see a real baseball game, it might be worth the trip. <br>
KASIDY: If you ever decide to go, I'll take you there myself. As long
as you don't mind travelling by freighter. <br>
SISKO: I just might take you up on that. <br>
KASIDY: (sees the table) Did you do this all yourself? <br>
SISKO: My father always says the way to a woman's heart is through her

KASIDY: So it's my heart you're after. <br>
SISKO: I never could keep a secret. <br>
KASIDY: In that case, maybe you could tell me what all those
maintenance crews are doing in the docking ring. <br>
SISKO: Just some retrofitting. <br>
KASIDY: Now you are keeping a secret. <br>
SISKO: Let's just say we're preparing a few surprises just in case the
Dominion comes through the wormhole. <br>
KASIDY: Seems like everyone's got the Dominion on their minds these

SISKO: Certainly. They can come aboard any time they like. <br>

you can perform. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's what I like about you, Julian. You're easily impressed.
<br>
BASHIR: Thank you, Quark. Can we get a little yamok sauce for these
sand peas? Quark? <br>
QUARK: Listen, do you hear that? <br>
BASHIR: I don't hear a thing. <br>
QUARK: Exactly. The ambient noise level in this room is less than
thirty decibels. On an average day it's sixty five. When there're
Klingons in the room, it can go as high as eighty-five. <br>
O'BRIEN: So what you're saying is, it's quiet in here. <br>
QUARK: Too quiet. Something is terribly wrong. <br>
BASHIR: Like what? <br>
QUARK: I don't know. But have you ever met a quiet Klingon before? Look
how they're watching the room. It's like they're picking out targets.
Where are you going? <br>
O'BRIEN: I thought I'd ask the Klingons what they're up to. <br>
QUARK: Don't do that. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why not? <br>
QUARK: I don't want them to know we're on to them. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, suit yourself. <br>
(O'Brien sits down again. Bashir tries the sand pea flip trick and
misses.) <br>
O'BRIEN: The secret is positioning the pea correctly on the hand. <br>
BASHIR: But I thought I had that. <br>
QUARK: What are you two doing? I'm telling you, the Klingons are up to
something. <br>
BASHIR: Calm down, Quark. The Klingons are our allies. <br>
QUARK: They might be your allies, but they're not mine. <br>
O'BRIEN: Relax. If something's up with the Klingons, Captain Sisko will
find out about it. <br>

say we are. <br>

drip onto the table) <br>
KIRA: You think we're changelings? <br>
MARTOK: What I think doesn't matter. The blood will tell. <br>
(Sisko cuts his hand and lets the blood drip. Kira does the same.) <br>
SISKO: Now that that's over with. <br>
MARTOK: We have been sent here to fight alongside our Federation allies
against the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate your gesture, but I'm not sure it's necessary. <br>
MARTOK: The Klingon High Council thinks it is. <br>
SISKO: Our communications relay in the Gamma Quadrant hasn't detected
any signs of Jem'Hadar activity for quite some time. They seem to be
giving the wormhole a wide berth. <br>

just gave me the most amazing massage, and I'm sure if you ask nicely
he'll do the same for you. <br>
KIRA: No, thanks. <br>
DAX: Why? <br>
KIRA: Because Malko's not real. He's a puppet made out of holographic
light and replicated matter. <br>
DAX: Boys, can you wait outside? <br>
KIRA: Are you afraid I hurt their feelings? <br>
DAX: You really should try to get into the spirit of things. People
come from all over Trill to visit the Hoobishan Baths. <br>
KIRA: And if I'm ever on Trill I'll visit them too. But we're not on
Trill and this isn't the Hoobishan Baths. It's a holosuite and none of
it is real. <br>
DAX: And? <br>
KIRA: And? I'm sorry. I feel silly. <br>
DAX: Good. That's what a holosuite's for. To have a good time. All you
have to do is relax and use your imagination. <br>
KIRA: I guess I don't have much of an imagination. <br>
DAX: Of course you do. Everyone does. Didn't you play make-believe when
you were a child? <br>
KIRA: Yeah. I used to make-believe that the Cardassians would stop
killing the Bajorans and just go away. <br>
DAX: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to <br>
KIRA: No. I'm sorry. I guess I never had much use for my imagination. I
mean, look at me. You plan a fun evening for us and all I can do is sit
here and worry about Klingons. <br>
DAX: You can worry about the Klingons tomorrow. From what I hear,
they're not going anywhere. And as for your underdeveloped imagination,
I prescribe a strict regimen of exercise starting immediately. <br>
KIRA: All right. I'll give it a try. <br>

GARAK: Fascinating. So both the cup and the liquid are merely
extensions of your body. <br>
ODO: That is correct. And if I want to, I can even drink the liquid,
reabsorb it, and produce new coffee in the cup. (he demonstrates) This
way I can give the illusion that I'm sharing in the dining experience. <br>
GARAK: Very thoughtful. Tell me, Odo, have you heard any news from
Cardassia lately? <br>
ODO: Not since they sealed their borders. <br>
GARAK: Well I have, and frankly I don't like what I've heard. Rumours
of uprisings, civil disturbance. It's all very alarming. <br>
ODO: I didn't know you still had friends inside the Empire. <br>
GARAK: One or two, but I can't even get through to them now. That's
what worries me. With the destruction of the Obsidian Order and the
threat of the Dominion, these are unsettling times for Cardassia. <br>
ODO: They're unsettling for everyone. <br>

DREX: I don't take orders from shape-shifters, or their Cardassian
lapdogs. <br>
ODO: I may be a shape-shifter, but I am also Chief of Security of this

GARAK: Constable Odo and Captain Sisko expressed similar concern. But
really, Doctor, there was no harm done. <br>
BASHIR: They broke seven of your transverse ribs and fractured your
clavicle. <br>
GARAK: Ah, but I got off several cutting remarks which no doubt did
serious damage to their egos. <br>
BASHIR: Garak, this isn't funny. <br>
GARAK: I'm serious, Doctor. Thanks to your ministrations, I am almost
completely healed. But the damage I did to them will last a lifetime.
What I can't understand is their inexplicable hostility toward me.
Maligning Constable Odo is one thing. After all, he's a changeling. The
Klingons don't know him as well as we do. But relations between the
Klingon and Cardassian Empires have never been anything but amicable. <br>
BASHIR: With the exception of the Betreka Nebula incident. <br>
GARAK: A minor skirmish. <br>
BASHIR: That lasted eighteen years. <br>
GARAK: That was ages ago. Perhaps they decided they just didn't like

KAYBOK [on viewscreen]: We have orders to search all vessels attempting
to leave Bajoran space. <br>
KIRA: Search them for what? <br>
KAYBOK [on viewscreen]: For shape-shifters. Each ship will be scanned,
its cargo searched, and its crewmembers and passengers subjected to
genetic testing. <br>
SISKO: On whose authority? <br>
KAYBOK [on viewscreen]: On the authority of Gowron and the Klingon High
Council. <br>
KIRA: The Klingon High Council has no jurisdiction over ships in
Bajoran space. <br>
KAYBOK [on viewscreen]: We assumed you would welcome our assistance. <br>
SISKO: Do you have any evidence that there are changelings aboard this
particular ship? <br>
KAYBOK [on viewscreen]: How can we have evidence until we conduct our
tests? <br>
KIRA: Commander, Bajoran law strictly prohibits any unwarranted search
and seizure of vessels in our territory. <br>
KAYBOK [on viewscreen]: I have my orders. <br>

DAX: The Klingon ship has increased power to its tractor beam. It looks
like they're preparing to board the Xhosa. <br>

law. Now, I will ask you one last time. Release that ship immediately. <br>

Cardassian homeworld. The Central Command has been overthrown and power
transferred to civilian authorities. <br>
SISKO: Even if your source is correct, what does that have to do with
the Klingons? <br>

the Dominion. <br>

WORF: None that I know of, but they are convinced that civilians could
not have overthrown the Central Command without help. <br>

The Cardassian dissident movement has been gathering strength for
years. With the Obsidian Order out of the way, they might have finally
succeeded. <br>
WORF: The issue is not if there are any Founders on Cardassia. There
are many Klingons who say we have been at peace too long, that the
Empire must expand in order to survive. Fear of the Dominion has given
my people an excuse to do what they were born to do. To fight and to
conquer. <br>

What good would it do for the Klingons to defeat Cardassia, if they
don't control the wormhole? <br>

SISKO: I am aware of that. But maybe you're not aware of what you're
risking. We've had a year to prepare this station for a Dominion attack
and we're more than ready. <br>
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: You are like a toothless old grishnar cat,
trying to frighten us with your roar. <br>
SISKO: I can assure you, this old cat may not be as toothless as you
think. Right now, I've got five thousand photon torpedoes armed and
ready to launch. If you don't believe me, feel free to scan the
station. </font></p>

any farther. <br>

WORF: There is another wave of Klingon ships coming in. <br>
O'BRIEN: I've got the shields back up, but I don't know how long
they'll hold. <br>
DAX: I'm reading a cluster of warp signatures approaching, bearing one
eight seven mark zero two five. It's Starfleet, Benjamin. Six
starships, led by the Venture. They'll be here in fifteen minutes. <br>
SISKO: Contact the Negh'Var again. Maybe now Gowron will be in the mood
to talk. <br>
DAX: I've got him. <br>
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: Captain, your shields have been weakened, your
station boarded, and more Klingon ships are on their way. Surrender
while you can. <br>
SISKO: I don't think so. My shields are holding, your boarding parties
are contained, and my reinforcements are closer than yours. You're
facing a war on two fronts. Is that what you really want? <br>
WORF: The Empire is not strong enough to fight the Federation and the
Cardassians. End this now, Gowron, before you lead the Empire to its
worst defeat in history. <br>
MARTOK [on viewscreen]: We will not surrender! <br>
SISKO: This is exactly what the Founders want. Klingon against
Cardassian, Federation against Klingon. The more we fight each other,
the weaker we'll get, and the less chance we have against the Dominion.
<br>
WORF: Consider what you do here, Gowron. Kahless himself said,
destroying an Empire to win a war is no victory. </font></p>

MARTOK: We can still win! <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: Not before those starships get here. Now, what
do I tell them? To stand down or to come in firing? <br>
GOWRON: It is we who shall stand down. <br>
MARTOK: Ach Gowron, yay chol.<br>
GOWRON: Enough. Cease fire. Order our ships in Cardassian territory to
halt their advance. I do not intend to hand victory to the Dominion.

returned to the Klingon home world and his task force has withdrawn
from Bajoran space. I don't know if I can fully express the pride I
felt at seeing how well Deep Space Nine and it's crew weathered this
latest crisis. While the station suffered heavy damage during the
Klingon attack, repairs are well ahead of schedule and life on the
station is beginning to return to normal, leaving me with one final
piece of unfinished business.

WORF: Enter. <br>
SISKO: I brought your discharge papers. I thought you might want to
take a look at them before I send them off to Starfleet. <br>
WORF: Thank you, sir. <br>
SISKO: I understand you're headed for the Nyberrite Alliance. <br>
WORF: Yes. I leave this afternoon. <br>
SISKO: For me, it was a job on Earth, directing construction of orbital
habitats. <br>
WORF: Why did you change your mind? <br>
SISKO: I finally realised that it wasn't Starfleet I wanted to get away
from. I was trying to escape the pain I felt after my wife's death. I
thought I could take the uniform, wrap it around that pain and toss
them both away. But it doesn't work like that. Running may help for a
little while, but sooner or later the pain catches up with you, and the
only way to get rid of it is to stand your ground and face it. <br>
WORF: But wearing that uniform must remind you of what you have lost. <br>
SISKO: Sometimes. But it also reminds me of what I've gained, and who I
am. Oh, I can throw away the uniform, resign my commission, run all the
way to the Nyberrite Alliance, but it really wouldn't matter. A
Starfleet officer. That's what I am, and that's what I'll always be. <br>
WORF: And you think that is true of me as well. <br>
SISKO: What's important, Mister Worf, is what you think. <br>
WORF: I think Starfleet has been my home for many years. Perhaps it
still is. <br>
SISKO: There are starships out there that are in need of good officers.
In fact, the captain of the Venture is a friend of mine. If you'd like,
I can talk to him, see if he has an opening for a lieutenant commander.

WORF: Perhaps that will not be necessary.

SISKO: Assume your post, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: You look good in red. <br>
WORF: It feels good. But I have a lot to learn about Command. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, you couldn't ask for a better teacher. <br>
SISKO: Now that everyone is here, I wanted you to know I've spoken to
Dukat and several members of the Detapa Council. They've returned to
Cardassia Prime without incident and wanted me to convey to you their
personal thanks. <br>
KIRA: Who'd have thought I'd help save the Cardassian government? <br>
ODO: Don't worry. I'm sure Dukat will take all the credit. <br>
BASHIR: Poor Garak. Dukat's a hero, and Garak's still stuck in his
tailor shop hemming trousers. <br>
DAX: Captain, I'm receiving a priority one message from Starfleet
Intelligence. The Klingons are refusing to give up several of the
Cardassian colonies they seized during the invasion. They're fortifying
their positions and deploying orbital defence systems. <br>
KIRA: Looks like the Klingons are here to stay. <br>
SISKO: Maybe they are. But so are we. </font> </p>
