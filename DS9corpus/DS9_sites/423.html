Last time on Deep Space Nine. <br></i><br>SISKO: This is the emblem of the Alliance for Global
Unity. They call themselves the Circle. <br>
O'BRIEN: What gives them the right to mess up our station? <br>
ODO: They're an extremist faction who believe in Bajor for the
Bajorans. <br>
SISKO: I can't loan you a Starfleet runabout without knowing where you
plan on taking it. <br>
KIRA: To Cardassia Four to rescue a Bajoran prisoner of war. <br>
(The prisoners are rescued.) <br>
KIRA: Come on. We have a ship waiting. <br>
SISKO: (to Dax) What if I told you that I knew someone who could bring
stability to Bajor. Someone who could unite the factions and give us a
chance to do our job. <br>
SISKO: But Bajor doesn't need a man. It needs a symbol, and that's what
you are. <br>
JARO: The Navarch needed to return here to assume his new post. He's
been made the Bajoran liaison officer to Deep Space Nine. <br>
SISKO: I already have a liaison officer. <br>
JARO: Not anymore you don't. Major Kira is no longer assigned to this
post. She's been recalled to Bajor. <br>
QUARK: It's over. Everything. Bajor, the provisional government, the
Federation being here, all of it. We've got to leave. <br>
SISKO: The provisional government will stand only if the military
supports it. <br>
KRIM: We are all patriots, Commander. <br>
JARO: I am the Circle, Major. <br>
KIRA: How can you betray your own government? <br>
ODO: The Circle's being supplied by the Cardassians. <br>
KIRA: What? <br>
ODO: I borrowed the proof. It's got a Gul's thumb scan on it. <br>
KIRA: The Circle hates the Cardassians. <br>
ODO: They don't know it is the Cardassians. They think they've been
buying from Kressari traders. <br>
JARO: Think of the prestige of having the new leader of Bajor being a
member of your Order. <br>
WINN: If you are the new leader. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, two assault vessels are headed this way on a direct
course from Bajor. They've given all non-Bajorans seven hours to
evacuate. <br><i><br>And now, the conclusion. </i>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Starfleet feels it has no other choice. The
Federation is here at the invitation of the Bajoran provisional
government. <br>
BASHIR: No more provisional government, no more invitation. <br>
SISKO: Governments can break off relations with an edict. It's not so
easy when it comes down to our level. Lieutenant Bilecki here is
engaged to a young man from Bajor. Ensign Kelly. Ensign Kelly's
daughter and a Bajoran girl worked together on a prize-winning science
fair project. All of us who have served on the station for the past
year have made Bajoran friends. We've come to care about what happens
to these people. I know I do. So I've decided to stay. Just to make
sure the evacuation is conducted properly. <br>
O'BRIEN: You'll need someone to oversee the inventory process, sir. <br>
BASHIR: Packing up all my medical supplies could take quite a while,
Commander. <br>
SISKO: Before you volunteer too quickly, understand what you're getting
into. We'll be trying to delay the takeover of the station as long as
possible. Hopefully as long as it takes to expose the Cardassian's
involvement in all this. It won't be easy. The Bajoran assault forces
have been told that the Federation is their blood enemy. Jaro and the
Circle would love nothing more than to have my head and yours and
present them to the Chamber of Ministers. This is your last chance to
leave here in one piece. Some of you have families. Some are on
temporary assignment. I wouldn't blame anyone for getting out now while
you can. I mean that. Anyone who wants to evacuate is dismissed. <br>
(No one moves.) <br>
SISKO: Non-Bajorans won't be safe here. Our families, children have to
be evacuated. I'm sure many of the Bajorans who have worked with us
will want to leave too. There's a lot to get done. The assault vessels
will be here in less than five hours. Dismissed. </font></p>

QUARK: Hundreds of people to evacuate and only three tiny runabouts
available. Do you know what that means? <br>
ROM: It means a lot of people will be left behind. Tragic. Yes,
brother, your compassion never ceases to amaze me <br>
QUARK: It means we're going to make a fortune. <br>
ROM: We are? <br>
QUARK: People will pay anything for a seat on those ships. <br>
ROM: You can't make me. I won't sell my seat. <br>
QUARK: Rom <br>
ROM: No, I won't stay and be killed just to fill your pockets. <br>
QUARK: Rom, do you actually believe that I would sacrifice my own
brother's life for personal profit? <br>
(Rom nods.) <br>
QUARK: It would have to be the deal of a lifetime. <br>
ROM: Yes, my lifetime. <br>
QUARK: Listen to me. We're both going to escape. But our bags will be
packed with all the gold-pressed latinum we can carry. </font></p>

JAKE: That's not where I'm going. <br>
NOG: But my dad told me <br>
JAKE: My ship's going to the Korat system. I guess that's where they're
taking all the Starfleet families. <br>
NOG: This'll be over in no time. We'll be back in school driving Mrs
O'Brien crazy again in a few days. <br>
JAKE: Just when I think I've found a new home, made a new friend, it
always seems like I got to leave. <br>
NOG: Hey, Human. <br>
JAKE: Cut it out. <br>
NOG: Has there ever been one of your kind and one of mine who were
better friends? <br>
JAKE: Never. <br>
NOG: And if our fathers couldn't break us up, no stupid coupe day.
Coupe dey <br>
JAKE: Coup d'Ã©tat. It's French. <br>
NOG: No stupid French thing will either. We'll see each other again
soon. That's a promise. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: I've scanned every subspace communication
window to find a frequency to Bajor. They've got them completely
jammed. <br>
KIRA: Then we have no choice. We'll have to take the proof to the
Chamber of Ministers. <br>
LI: Jaro's forces will be scanning for any incoming vessels. <br>
SISKO: A runabout could handle a Bajoran patrol. Unfortunately I don't
have one to give you <br>
LI: The Lunar Five base? <br>
KIRA: You think there's still a ship there? <br>
LI: We managed to get a few sub-impulse raiders underground before the
Cardassians hit us, but that was ten years ago. <br>
KIRA: Can one of the evacuation vessels take a detour and drop me off? <br>
SISKO: What if you get there and those raiders won't fly? <br>
KIRA: Then I'll just have to wait to hear from you, I guess. <br>
SISKO: You may be waiting a long time. Dax, do any of your former hosts
have experience with sub-impulse thruster configurations? <br>
DAX: Yes. Tobin Dax. <br>
KIRA: Tobin? I don't think I've heard about this one. <br>
DAX: My second host. Barely a sex life and no imagination, but he knew
phase coil inverters like no one else. <br>
SISKO: Major Kira could use his experience today. <br>
(Odo arrives with Quark in his grasp) <br>
QUARK: I have no time for this foolishness! I still have to pack! <br>
(Dax and Kira leave) <br>
SISKO: What's the problem? <br>
ODO: He's been brokering seats on the evacuation vessels. <br>
SISKO: Where did you get more seats? <br>
QUARK: Everybody always asks the brokers where they get their extra
seats, and all I can say is, it's my business to find preferred seating
for a select list of clients <br>
SISKO: I have got more than two hundred people who want to get off this
station. Where did you get more seats? <br>
QUARK: A few trades. A person here or there who changed his mind about
leaving at the sight of a reasonable stipend. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: Bashir to Commander Sisko. <br>

justified. I have complete faith in Commander Sisko's ability to
straighten this out. <br>
ODO: I'll pass that on. He'll be so pleased to know that he has your
confidence. <br>
QUARK: As I'm no longer needed, my brother is waiting for me on the

SISKO: Don't you understand? There isn't room for everyone. We have to
get our families, our children and non-Bajorans <br>
LI: Where are you running to? This is Bajor. We are Bajorans. We fought
a war to regain our homeland. How can you abandon it like frightened
Cardassian voles? These ships are for our guests who must leave because
it is no longer safe for them here. However, we are Bajorans. And I say
that we stay and we solve our problems together. Are you willing to
join me? <br>
SISKO: As soon as the passenger lists are confirmed, get these ships
out of here. <br>
BASHIR: They're almost ready to go, sir. The Rio Grande is full and so
is the Orinoco. <br>
SISKO: Get them launched. <br>
BASHIR: Aye, sir. <br>
(Morn and Kira board.) <br>
SISKO: Are you ready? <br>
JAKE: I've been thinking. I really think it'd be better if I stayed.
Look, I just don't want anything to happen to you. <br>
SISKO: That makes two of us. <br>
JAKE: What's this? <br>
SISKO: A letter I wrote you. <br>
JAKE: A letter? <br>
SISKO: Just some things. <br>

SISKO: Sisko to Ganges. Proceed with launch. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Acknowledged. Good luck, Commander. Kira out. <br>
QUARK: No! No! Wait! <br>
(Quark is slowed down by a very heavy suitcase that clunks) <br>
QUARK: My ship, the Rio Grande, my brother's on it. He's got my ticket.
<br>
BASHIR: That ship was full, sir. I checked the list myself and Quark's
name wasn't on it. His brother Rom did go aboard, but he was with a
dabo girl.<br>
QUARK: A dabo girl? What? <br>
SISKO: Looks like he sold your seat. <br>
(Sisko and Bashir walk off.) <br>
QUARK: No, you don't understand. You don't understand! I can't stay
here. I'll be hung. Call the ships back! I'll pay anyone five bars of
gold pressed latinum for a seat. Ten bars. Twenty. </font></p>

KRIM: The most strategic position in the entire sector, at the mouth of
the wormhole. Had I been Federation commander, I would not have
abandoned it so easily. <br>

DAX: Well, he biochemical connections between the host and symbiont
can't tolerate the. Oh! Whoa! What's that? Is that a spider or a dog? <br>
KIRA: Palukoo. The Bajoran moons are full of them. <br>
DAX: I suppose you used to make them your pets and sing songs about
them around the campfire. <br>

without thinking. <br>
DAX: Encouraging. <br>
KIRA: Bend your knees, you'll fit. <br>
(She persuades the cockpit cover to finally close again.) <br>
KIRA: The real trick will be to fire up these thrusters after all this

every day. <br>

KRIM: Scan the Operations Centre for organic material. <br>
OFFICER: Organic? <br>
KRIM: The station's security chief is apparently missing. The

perhaps there's something more here than meets the eye. <br>

resistance so far. <br>

JARO [on viewscreen]: When I announce that we've secured the station,
it will certainly impact the <br>
KRIM: Minister, I urge caution. The battle for this station hasn't even
begun yet. <br>
JARO [on viewscreen]: You expect the enemy to return, General? <br>
KRIM: I'm not convinced they ever left. The internal security net has
been sabotaged. We have no way of tracking the movements of anyone on
board, which suggests someone didn't want to be that easily found. <br>
JARO [on viewscreen]: Kira? <br>
KRIM: Perhaps. She is unaccounted for. So too is Security Chief Odo. So
is Li Nalas. <br>
JARO [on viewscreen]: You're right. Li Nalas would never abandon Bajor.

support. <br>
JARO: I'll offer him anything he wants to make sure he does. Short of
becoming the next Kai, of course. <br>
WINN: You have a unique ability to build a consensus, Essa. Bajor has
been waiting for a leader like you. <br>
JARO: Leaders like us. <br>
