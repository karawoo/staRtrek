Officer's log, stardate 47603.3. Commander Sisko has assigned me to
investigate an unusual particle field detected on the other side of the
wormhole. Odo has come along to Gamma Quadrant, hoping to find clues to
his origin.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: So you see, Ensign Manwaring has spent the
last two weeks avoiding the assay office because he thought that Freyla
was in love with Lieutenant Strek, but all the while Strek was seeing
Security Officer Seelee. And Freyla was waiting for Manwaring to ask
her out. <br>
ODO: Officer Seelee has seemed distracted at work lately. I'm going to
have to talk to her about this when I get back to the station. <br>
DAX: Odo, I didn't tell you that story to get Seelee in trouble. <br>
ODO: Frankly, Lieutenant, I fail to see any point in your story at all,
except perhaps to illustrate the foolish humanoid preoccupation with
romantic coupling. <br>
DAX: The point is that sometimes we don't see true love even when it's
staring us right in the face. <br>
ODO: How fascinating. <br>
DAX: Let me give you another example. You know Lysia Arlin? <br>
ODO: The Bolian woman who runs the jumja kiosk. <br>
DAX: I've noticed she's been making a lot of visits to the Security
Office lately. <br>
ODO: She has a cousin who's interested in a career in law enforcement. <br>
DAX: You don't say. <br>
ODO: Are you implying that Lysia Arlin is interested in me? Ridiculous.
I would have noticed. <br>
DAX: Exactly my point. <br>
ODO: You must be mistaken. <br>
DAX: And how can you be so sure? <br>
ODO: Because women don't react to me in that manner. <br>
DAX: Are you saying that you've never had a female friend? <br>
ODO: I consider Major Kira a friend. <br>
DAX: That's not what I meant. I'm talking about an intimate friendship.
<br>
ODO: That's a very personal question. <br>
DAX: I'm sorry, but after seven lifetimes the impersonal questions
aren't much fun anymore. <br>
ODO: Huh. <br>
DAX: Looks like we found our particle field. They're omicron particles.
<br>
ODO: Is that unusual? <br>
DAX: Omicron particles are incredibly rare. They can only be created by
certain types of matter-antimatter reactions. The field seems to be
coming from the second planet in the system. Let's go a little closer.
(zoom) That's strange. The particles are concentrated in one small
valley. <br>
ODO: Sensors aren't picking up any lifeforms. <br>
DAX: The particle field could be interfering with the sensors. We'd
better beam down for a closer look.

buildings. There's a big device in the middle) <br>
DAX: I'm still getting a lot of interference. The particle field must
be blocking the tricorder functions. <br>
(They go to the device) <br>
DAX: The interference seems to be coming from here. This must be the
source of the field. It's probably some kind of matter-antimatter
reactor. <br>
ODO: Lieutenant, I suggest we leave before we're discovered. <br>
DAX: Give me a minute. <br>

QUARK: It's about time. Enter. Where have you been? I've been waiting
hours. Major. Er, I'm sorry. We're closed. You'll have to come back in
the morning. <br>
KIRA: Oh, I didn't come here for a drink. I thought you'd like to know
your cousin Kono just tried to come aboard the station. <br>
QUARK: Kono? Here? What an unexpected pleasure. <br>
KIRA: He's gone, Quark. When we tried to talk to him, he beamed onto a
departing Tellarite freighter. <br>
QUARK: There must be some mistake. Why would Kono be coming here? <br>
KIRA: I was wondering the same thing myself, so I did a little
checking. Your cousin's wanted for robbing a museum on Cardassia Five.
My guess is he thought someone here would help him sell the
merchandise. <br>
QUARK: Outrageous. You have no proof of that. <br>
KIRA: Quark, get this into that twisted little brain of yours. If you
thought you were going to get away with anything while Odo's gone,
think again. I'm watching you. <br>
QUARK: Major, you make it sound like you don't like me. <br>
KIRA: Don't like you? You collaborated with the Cardassians, you cheat
your customers, and you're a danger to this station. I don't just not
like you, I despise you. <br>

JAKE: Yeah. <br>
SISKO: You're almost as old as he is. When I was your age, I had a job,
and it was a terrific experience. <br>
JAKE: All right. I'll talk to Nog and see if he can get me a job at
Quark's. <br>
SISKO: Quarks? I was thinking more along the lines of you helping out
Chief O'Brien. <br>
JAKE: Chief O'Brien? <br>
SISKO: You do like Chief O'Brien, don't you? <br>
JAKE: He's okay, but I don't know anything about engineering. <br>
SISKO: This is the perfect opportunity to learn. Besides it'll look
great on your application to Starfleet Academy. <br>
JAKE: Okay, I'll give it a try. <br>

COLYUS: So you keep saying. <br>
DAX: If you want, you can check our ship's logs and they'll prove it to
you. <br>
COLYUS: Logs can be tampered with. Well, you ought know that. After
all, you claim to be a Security Officer. <br>
ODO: I am a Security Officer and I've had enough of this. If we were
guilty, we wouldn't even be here right now. I'll prove it. Computer,

DAX: Don't worry, he'll be right back. <br>

COLYUS: Now that's interesting, you disappearing like that, because
I've got twenty two people who've disappeared without a trace. <br>
ODO: Twenty two missing people? Did they all disappear at the same
time? <br>
COLYUS: No, it started in the fall. But the last victim vanished six
hours ago. <br>
DAX: Six hours ago we weren't even in this system. If you want, you can
accompany us back to our station and they will verify everything we've
told you. <br>
ODO: Do you have any other suspects? <br>
COLYUS: You were my only ones. I'm not saying everybody here is
perfect. We have some petty thefts, an occasional fight, but kidnapping
or murder? No, no, we've never had anything like that before. <br>
ODO: I see. So, Have you scanned the area for signs of transporter
activity? <br>
COLYUS: It was the first thing I tried. I didn't find anything. You
know, I've been protector here for almost ten years. I like to think
I'm pretty good at my job. People trust me to solve their problems. But
whoever's behind these disappearances is a lot smarter than I am. I
have to admit, I'm starting to get desperate. <br>
ODO: Maybe what you need is a little help. <br>
COLYUS: Maybe.

COLYUS: Rurigan. <br>
RURIGAN: So, these are the strangers I heard about. Shouldn't they be
in a cell? <br>
COLYUS: I'm satisfied they have nothing to do with the disappearances.
In fact, Odo here is a Security Officer. He's going to try to help us. <br>
RURIGAN: And how do you plan to do that? <br>
ODO: I understand your daughter is the latest victim. When was the last
time you saw her? <br>
RURIGAN: This morning, at first meal. But Taya said she saw her later,
in her workroom around midday. <br>
ODO: Taya? <br>
RURIGAN: My granddaughter. Colyus, Anetra's gone just like the others.
We're never going to find them. <br>
ODO: How can you be so sure? <br>
RURIGAN: Let's just say I haven't been proven wrong yet. <br>
DAX: I'd like to scan the area again for transporter activity, in case
you missed something. <br>
COLYUS: Go right ahead. <br>
DAX: I'm still not getting a clear reading. The omicron particles put
out by the reactor are creating too much interference. <br>
COLYUS: It must be your equipment. Our scanners never give any trouble.
<br>
(Colyus gives her his tricorder.) <br>
DAX: Certain kinds of transporters leave behind a residual
electrostatic charge. If we could check Anetra's workroom? <br>
(Dax and Colyus leave) <br>

you to her.

ODO: When I was younger, people were always asking me to change shape

see me become a chair or an animal. None of them ever really cared

DAX: No. It's not a transporter. It's a holographic projector. It
creates an omicron particle field and then manipulates the field to
form physical objects like your cloak. <br>
COLYUS: What does this have to do with the missing people? <br>
DAX: The people are made up of omicron particles too. <br>
COLYUS: You mean they're holograms? <br>
DAX: I'm afraid so. You see, the component that controls the particle
field, it's breaking down, and that's why people are disappearing. <br>
COLYUS: That's ridiculous. Some of the victims were my friends. One of
them is my nephew. <br>
DAX: If I'm right, everyone and everything in this village is a
holographic projection. <br>
COLYUS: And I thought I was desperate to find an answer. <br>
ODO: Listen to me, Colyus. I know this is difficult to accept. <br>
COLYUS: It's going to take a whole lot more than a vanishing cloak to
make me believe that I'm some kind of hologram. <br>
ODO: I'd be sceptical too if I were you, but we have further proof. <br>
COLYUS: What kind of proof? <br>
DAX: The holographic field ends just outside this valley, and earlier
today Taya tried to reach past the edge and her arm disappeared. <br>
COLYUS: Is she all right? <br>
ODO: She's fine. Her arm rematerialised as soon as she pulled it back
inside. <br>
COLYUS: Where exactly did this happen? <br>
DAX: We could show you, if you'd like. <br>
COLYUS: I think you'd better.

BAREIL: Don't apologise. I should have seen it coming. Where did you
learn to play like that? <br>
KIRA: My brothers and I used to play at the Singha refugee camp. There
wasn't much else to do. <br>
BAREIL: Yeah, I was at Relliketh. And now here we are. That was
delicious. <br>
KIRA: Thank the replicators. <br>
BAREIL: Here, let me help. <br>
KIRA: That's not necessary. Your shoulder <br>
BAREIL: Never felt better. <br>
KIRA: Maybe I could use some help after all. <br>
(A kiss) <br>
KIRA: I'll have to remember to thank Prylar Rhit for inviting you here.
<br>
BAREIL: You'd better tell him soon. Prylar Rhit is going to be
returning to Bajor. It appears he fancies himself something of a dabo
player. <br>
KIRA: Really? <br>
BAREIL: He's run up a sizable gambling debt. It's caused quite a
scandal in the Vedek Assembly. <br>
KIRA: Let me get this straight. The man who invited you to the station
owes money to Quark? <br>
BAREIL: Who? <br>
KIRA: The little troll who runs the dabo tables. I have to go. <br>
BAREIL: Why? <br>
KIRA: I need to talk to Prylar Rhit. I think I know the real reason he
invited you here.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's a rowdy village meeting) <br>
COLYUS: People, please. Please! Quiet! Quiet! Calm down! Quiet! Calm
down, everybody. We have to make a decision here. <br>
MERRUK: Colyus, you should be out looking for my wife and all the
others who are missing. <br>
FEMALE: Not wasting time listening to these strangers and their lies. <br>
COLYUS: You all witnessed what happened when they brought us to the
edge of the field. Merruk, we both saw your hand disappear. <br>
MERRUK: It could've been a trick. <br>
DAX: It wasn't a trick. <br>
FEMALE: Then how come we've never learned about this before. <br>
ODO: Because none of you ever tried to leave the valley. <br>
COLYUS: It's possible we were programmed not to leave so that we
wouldn't learn the truth. Now, we have to shut down the system. If we
don't fix it soon, the whole village will disappear. Dax, you said if
you can fix the machine, you might be able to bring back the missing
people. <br>
DAX: We hope so. <br>
RURIGAN: What if you turn off the projector and you can't get it back
on? <br>
DAX: Then this village will cease to exist. The system's only a few
months away from complete failure anyway. At least this way we have a
chance to save you. <br>
TAYA: Grandfather, please, let her try. <br>
MERRUK: What do you think? <br>
RURIGAN: Well, we can't go on like this. I guess we should let her shut
it down. <br>
COLYUS: Are there any objections? Then it's settled. <br>
TAYA: I can't wait to see my mother. <br>
(Taya runs over to Odo.) <br>
TAYA: Your face isn't so scary, once you get used to it. <br>
ODO: Thank you, Taya. <br>
DAX: All right, here we go. <br>
(The village, people and buildings, disappears except for) <br>
DAX: Odo. <br>
RURIGAN: Don't look so surprised. I'm as real as you are. <br>
(After the adverts) <br>
RURIGAN: I was happy living on Yadera Prime, that is, until the
Dominion took over and changed our whole way of life. I realised one
morning that I didn't really belong there anymore. So I came here, and
I used a holo-generator to recreate all the things that I'd lost. I've
lived here in my village for nearly thirty years. I've watched its
people marry, have children, grow old. And sometimes I even forgot that
they were holograms. But it's over. It's over. And I would appreciate
it if you'd take me back to Yadera Prime. <br>
ODO: But what about the villagers? What about your granddaughter? <br>
RURIGAN: She's not real. <br>
ODO: Technically, I suppose you're right. Maybe by our definition,
Taya's not real. Her memories are stored in a computer. Her body is
made up of omicron particles. But who's to say that our definition of
life is the only valid one. I'm sure if you asked her, she'd say she
was real. She thinks, she feels. <br>
RURIGAN: She only seems to. It's all an illusion. An illusion that I
created. <br>
ODO: You said you created the village thirty years ago. Taya's only
ten. <br>
RURIGAN: I designed the programme so the villagers could have children
if they wanted to. <br>
DAX: Then Taya's personality is a combination of her parent's
personalities. <br>
ODO: Just like a real child. You had nothing to do with it. <br>
RURIGAN: But she's still a hologram. <br>
ODO: Maybe, but I saw the way you held her hand when she was sad. I saw
the way you tried to comfort her when she was frightened. <br>
RURIGAN: I didn't want her to get hurt. <br>
ODO: If she's not real, what does it matter? <br>
RURIGAN: It matters. It matters to me. <br>
ODO: Why should it matter to you if a hologram cries? <br>
RURIGAN: Because I love her. <br>
DAX: And she loves you. <br>
ODO: Don't you see? She's real to you, and she's real to me too.
They're all real. And you can't turn your back on them now.

KIRA: Just thought I'd let you know. We caught your cousin trying to
slip back onto the station. and guess what we confiscated from him?
Bone-carvings stolen from a museum on Cardassia Five. <br>
QUARK: I always knew Kono was no good. <br>
KIRA: I only wish we could have caught the two of you together. <br>
QUARK: Life is full of disappointments. <br>
KIRA: By the way, Prylar Rhit tells me you encouraged him to invite
Bareil onto the station. <br>
QUARK: Is that a crime? <br>

diverting. <br>

please don't tell any of the others that I'm not like them. I don't

disappearing now. <br>
