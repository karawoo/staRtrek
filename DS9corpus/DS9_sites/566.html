BASHIR: See? Told you he would. <br>
VIC: Laurence Harvey, Richard Widmark and John Wayne as Davy Crockett.
Great battle scenes, nice sets, but way too long. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're not talking about a movie. <br>
BASHIR: No, we're talking about our holosuite programme. <br>
VIC: Oh, that Alamo. What about it? <br>
BASHIR: Well, we've got holosuite four reserved for an hour and we were
wondering whether you'd like to join us. <br>
VIC: Look fellas, I'm touched by the offer, but I don't know. <br>
O'BRIEN: We can transfer your matrix to the Alamo programme. <br>
BASHIR: You've got to leave of Vegas sometimes, right? <br>
VIC: True, but I'm afraid I have to say no. <br>
BASHIR: Why? <br>
VIC: I don't look good in buckskin. Tell you what I'll do though. How
about a little tune to get you into a Texas state of mind. Fellas,
Alamo. (singing) Standing around by the Alamo. Walking around in San
Antonio. Looking around for a new kind of love. <br>
(Zing and the place subtly changes to something less swanky and classy.
The band is hopeless and the audience boos him.) <br>
VIC: Baby I'm lonesome tonight. History abounds by the famous fort. <br>
MAN: Get him off! <br>
(The music changes to burlesque and on come the aggressive looking
showgirls.) <br>
MAN: Come on, step down, ya hack. Oh, honey. Show me, show me! <br>
VIC: What the hell? <br>
BASHIR: What is all this? <br>
VIC: Don't ask me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe there's a pointer fault in the holosuite's parameter
file. <br>
FRANKIE: Well, look who's here. The pretty boy singer himself. <br>
VIC: Frankie Eyes. What are you doing in Vegas? <br>
FRANKIE: What happened to 'Hello, Frankie, long time no see. Make
yourself at home. Can I get you anything?' You believe this guy? <br>
CICCI: (the muscle) No manners. <br>
FRANKIE: Were you born in a barn or something? <br>
BASHIR: This gentleman a friend of yours? <br>
VIC: We know each other. <br>
FRANKIE: We're a long way from South Philly, ain't we, Vic? <br>
VIC: So, are you here on business or pleasure? <br>
FRANKIE: Let's just say I'm here to stay, while you, Vicky boy, are
about to take a powder. <br>
VIC: I'm not going anywhere. <br>
FRANKIE: I got news for you, pal. I just bought this hotel. You're
history. <br>
VIC: You can't fire me. I have a contract. <br>
FRANKIE: And you can paper your walls with it. You're finished in this
town, Vic. <br>
VIC: You're blackballing me? <br>
FRANKIE: As of this moment, you couldn't get a job as a singing busboy.
Now are you going to walk out of here, or do you have to be carried
out? Makes no difference to me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let me handle this. Computer. Delete characters Frankie Eyes
and I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. <br>
CICCI: Cicci. (pronounced Cheech.) <br>
O'BRIEN: And Cicci from the holosuite's programme. <br>
(Nothing happens.) <br>
CICCI: What's a holosuites? <br>
FRANKIE: Beats me. <br>
BASHIR: They're still here, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Computer, freeze programme. There must be a little problem in
the character deletion algorithm. <br>
(Cicci takes Vic by the lapels.) <br>
CICCI: I'll show you the door. <br>
VIC: Make that a big problem. <br>
FRANKIE: What's it going to be, pallie? <br>
VIC: I guess I start packing. <br>
FRANKIE: Smart boy. All right, Cicci, come on. Let's check out my
casino. <br>
(Frankie and Cicci leave.) <br>
BASHIR: So what do we do now? <br>
VIC: Nothing we can do. Frankie's a made man, capisce? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not talking about Frankie, I'm talking about fixing the
entire programme. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, we could shut it down manually and reset it. But that
would wipe Vic's memory. He'd forget everything that's happened since
we first activated him. <br>
VIC: Oh, hold on, pallie. Nobody's wiping my memory. <br>
BASHIR: Of course not. There must be some other way. <br>
O'BRIEN: I wish I knew what it was. <br>
BASHIR: Better talk to Felix. After all, he was the one who designed
this programme. <br>
VIC: You do that. <br>
O'BRIEN: In the meantime, you stay out of the way of Frankie Eyes. <br>
VIC: You'll get no argument from me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOG: I'll tell you one thing, if this Frankie Eyes
hurts Vic in any way, he's going to have to answer to me. <br>
WORF: I do not understand how you could feel such loyalty for a
hologram. <br>
NOG: He's not just a hologram, he's my friend. <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't you like Vic? <br>
WORF: As a singer, I find him entertaining. But beyond that, I neither
like him nor dislike him. He is a hologram, and therefore he does not
exist. <br>
KIRA: He does for me. <br>
(Bashir arrives and Worf leaves.) <br>
BASHIR: I just talked to Felix. I know what's been affecting Vic's
programme. It's a jack in the box. <br>
NOG: A what? <br>
O'BRIEN: A jack in the box. It's a children's toy on Earth. You wind it
up and a figure jumps out and goes Boo! <br>
BASHIR: Except this type of jack in the box is different. <br>
NOG: It doesn't go Boo? <br>
BASHIR: No, this surprise is buried deep in the holosuite programme. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's meant to shake things up, you know? Make things
interesting. <br>
NOG: I wasn't bored. Were you? <br>
KIRA: Not at all. I liked Vic's the way it was. <br>
BASHIR: According to Felix, if we get rid of Frankie Eyes, everything
resets back to the way it was. <br>
KIRA: That's good to know. <br>
NOG: So how do we get rid of Frankie Eyes? <br>
BASHIR: That's up to us. But Felix did warn me the programme is period
specific. <br>
O'BRIEN: In other words, if we shoot him, we have to use a forty five
automatic and not a phaser. <br>
BASHIR: We can't shoot Frankie, it's too dangerous. <br>
O'BRIEN: The mob could retaliate against Vic. <br>
BASHIR: If anything happens to Vic, his matrix will be eliminated from
the programme. Permanently. <br>
NOG: The news just keeps getting better, doesn't it? <br>
SISKO: What news? <br>
KIRA: Oh, nothing, sir. We're talking about a holosuite programme. <br>
BASHIR: Vic Fontaine's hotel's just been bought by gangsters. <br>
SISKO: I see. When do you plan on to going back to work? <br>
O'BRIEN: Right away, sir. <br>
(Sisko leaves.) <br>
NOG: Whatever you decide to do, Chief, count me in. I owe Vic. I
thought losing my leg was the end of my Starfleet career. He taught me
otherwise. <br>
KIRA: He changed my life, too. And Odo's. <br>
BASHIR: Now all we need is a plan.

KASIDY: It's getting better. <br>
SISKO: Something happen? <br>
KASIDY: It's Vic. <br>
SISKO: Vic? <br>
KASIDY: Vic Fontaine. A gangster named Frankie Eyes took over his
lounge. The whole place has changed and no one's sure how to change it
back. What? <br>
SISKO: Nothing. <br>
KASIDY: I guess this sounds pretty silly to you. <br>
SISKO: A little. <br>
KASIDY: You have to understand, Vic isn't just another holosuite
programme. He's more like a friend. <br>
SISKO: Kasidy, can we talk about something else? <br>
KASIDY: Sure. How come you've never been to Vic's? <br>
SISKO: Does it matter? You like going there and I don't. Let's leave it
at that. <br>
KASIDY: I was only asking. <br>
SISKO: And I gave you my answer. <br>
KASIDY: There are times when I just can't figure you out. <br>

BASHIR: Thanks. <br>
VIC: I feel better already. A jack in the box. I can't believe Felix
would do that to me. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, don't take it personally. He was just trying to do me a

VIC: I thought that was my job. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, and you're great at it. You know we love ya. <br>
O'BRIEN: So, you going to tell us what happened? <br>
VIC: I slipped in the bathtub. <br>
O'BRIEN: And knocked over this furniture looking for a bandage, right? <br>
VIC: Something like that. Frankie sent Tony Cicci to pay me a little
visit. He wanted to remind me not to take too long packing. <br>
O'BRIEN: What is it with you and Frankie? <br>
VIC: It goes back to the old neighbourhood when we were kids. I used to
beat him at stickball. <br>
BASHIR: And? <br>

O'BRIEN: That Felix, huh. When he designs a holosuite programme, he
doesn't fool around. <br>

VIC: A vacation? Did you guys take a vacation when the Dominion took
over DS Nine? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's not the same thing. <br>
VIC: It is to me. This is my life, remember? I don't run at the first

of that, Zeemo expects to be sent a couple of hundred grand. <br>

that guard away from the door for at least two minutes. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: Once he takes a sip of his drink, Howard'll come flying
out of that countroom at warp speed. <br>
