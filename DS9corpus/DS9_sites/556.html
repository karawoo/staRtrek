KIRA: A little lower. Lower. Lower. <br>
ODO: How's that? <br>
(He's morphed his hands into big paddles for better effect.) <br>
ODO: I hope this taught you a lesson. <br>
KIRA: What's that? <br>
ODO: Never play springball against a changeling. <br>
KIRA: Just for that, next time I'm not going to let you win a single
game. <br>
ODO: Then you'd better work on your backhand. <br>
KIRA: Right now, all I want to do is sleep for two or three (ouch)
days. <br>
ODO: Go right ahead, I should be back by the time you wake up. <br>
KIRA: Back? From where? <br>
ODO: I received a coded message from Gul Russol this morning. <br>
KIRA: Gul Russol? I thought he was executed when Cardassia joined the
Dominion. <br>
ODO: So did I, but apparently we were wrong. The message says he wants
to meet with me. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
ODO: I don't know, but he's my most reliable Cardassian informant. <br>
KIRA: You mean he was. What if Russol is dead and this is just a trap? <br>
ODO: I've thought about that, but I have to be sure. I owe him that
much. <br>
KIRA: Want me to come with you? <br>
ODO: Russol insists I come alone. Don't worry, Nerys. I'll be careful. <br>
KIRA: Worried? Ha. This just gives me more time to work on my backhand.

QUARK: Chief, how much longer is the Promenade going to be closed? My
bar is empty, my waiters are bored and I'm losing money. <br>
O'BRIEN: Leave me alone, Quark or I'll feed you to one of those plasma
conductors. <br>
QUARK: Are you threatening me? <br>
NOG: We're working as fast as we can. <br>
QUARK: As spokesman for the Promenade Merchant's Association, I'm going
to file an official protest with Captain Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Put it in writing, Quark. <br>
QUARK: I'll go find a PADD. <br>
(Quark leaves.) <br>
SISKO: So, how much longer, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, we should be through here by the end of the day, sir. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I'm not talking about the Promenade, I'm talking about the
Defiant. When is the gravity net going to be repaired? The last time I
stepped onto the bridge, I felt ten kilos heavier. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm afraid it's going to take some time. <br>
SISKO: How much time? <br>
O'BRIEN: About three weeks. We have to replace the graviton stabiliser.
<br>
SISKO: You have three days. I'm going to take the Defiant back out on
patrol and I don't want my crew getting queasy because the gravity
keeps fluctuating. <br>
O'BRIEN: But sir, the sector quartermaster said it would take three
weeks to get us a new stabiliser. <br>
SISKO: That is your problem, Chief. Now, I'm leaving for Bajor for a
conference and I want that stabiliser replaced by the time I get back.
Do I make myself clear? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
(Sisko leaves.) <br>
NOG: I don't want to sound negative, but I don't see how you're going
to get the Defiant ready in three days. <br>
O'BRIEN: Neither do I. <br>
NOG: This quartermaster you've been dealing with, what's his name? <br>
O'BRIEN: Chief, Chief, Chief Willoughby. <br>
NOG: I mean his first name. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know. <br>
NOG: Is he married? <br>
O'BRIEN: Married? What does that have to do with getting us a graviton
stabiliser? <br>
NOG: Everything. This Chief Willoughby must get hundreds of supply
requisitions every day. He can't possibly fill them all, so he puts
everyone on a waiting list. <br>
O'BRIEN: I know how he feels. I do the same thing. <br>
NOG: Well, the secret is getting him to put you at the top of that
list. The best way to do that is to form a relationship with him. Get
to know the name of his wife, his children, find out what he likes to
eat <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't have time to form a relationship with Willoughby. <br>
NOG: I do. I can get you that stabiliser, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: In three days? <br>
NOG: Leave everything to me. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, butt don't do anything I wouldn't do. <br>
NOG: Chief, I can't operate under those kinds of restrictions. <br>
O'BRIEN: At least promise me you won't do anything to get us
court-martialed. <br>
NOG: I'll try. <br>
O'BRIEN: Nog! <br>
NOG: Just kidding, Chief.

ODO: Russol? Russol. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm afraid he couldn't be here. <br>
ODO: Weyoun. <br>
WEYOUN: Founder. It is an honour to stand in your presence once again. <br>
ODO: Where's Gul Russol? <br>
WEYOUN: I'm afraid the Cardassian Central Command had him put to death
almost a year ago. I regret having to deceive you, but it was the only
way I could think of to get you here. <br>
ODO: Well, I'm here. What do you want? <br>
WEYOUN: To serve you. I no longer consider myself a member of the
Dominion. <br>
ODO: You're defecting? <br>
WEYOUN: Do with me as you wish. I place my fate entirely in your hands.
<br>
(And on that bombshell, the opening titles.) <br>
WEYOUN: You don't believe me, do you? <br>
ODO: I believe Gul Russol is dead. You say you're defecting from the
Dominion. Why? <br>
WEYOUN: Founder, please. <br>
ODO: I've told you before I'm not a Founder. <br>
WEYOUN: As you wish. Odo, I'll tell you everything you want to know but
first, we really should get aboard your runabout. The Jem'Hadar are
already hunting for me and if I'm found <br>
ODO: You haven't answered my question. Why did you decide to defect? <br>
WEYOUN: I realised my place is with you. <br>
ODO: You can do better than that. <br>
WEYOUN: Then let's just say I left Cardassia because my life was in
danger. <br>
ODO: From whom? <br>
WEYOUN: Everyone. <br>
ODO: Aren't you being a little paranoid? <br>
WEYOUN: Of course I'm paranoid. Everyone's trying to kill me. <br>
ODO: Why? <br>
WEYOUN: Because this war with the Federation was supposed to have been
won months ago. <br>
ODO: Well, things don't always turn out as planned. <br>
WEYOUN: Quite true. And when things go wrong, someone has to take the
blame. And this time, it's me. Now we really should be going. Think
about it, Odo. The information I possess could help the Federation win
this war. <br>
ODO: And you're willing to share that information? <br>
WEYOUN: All you have to do is ask. <br>
ODO: We've heard rumours that the Dominion has established a new
Ketracel White storage facility somewhere in Sector five zero seven. <br>
WEYOUN: The facility's located in the Pelosa system. I can supply you
with the exact coordinates. <br>
ODO: Odo to the Rio Grande. Two to beam up.

you're just another prisoner. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOG: I spoke to Edgar. <br>
O'BRIEN: Edgar who? <br>
NOG: Your new best friend, Chief Edgar Willoughby. He wanted me to
thank you for that bottle of Gamzian wine you sent him. <br>
O'BRIEN: I didn't send him any wine. <br>
NOG: I took the liberty of sending it for you. By the way, his wife's
name is Cynthia. They have a daughter, Melissa, age eight and a son,
Edgar junior, aged five. <br>
O'BRIEN: Did you get the stabiliser? <br>
NOG: Not quite. <br>
O'BRIEN: What do you mean, not quite? <br>
NOG: Unfortunately, he's out of stabilisers and won't be getting a new
shipment for another week. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's it. I'm doomed. <br>
NOG: Not necessarily. Eddie told me the USS Sentinel has an extra
stabiliser. <br>
O'BRIEN: What makes you think they're going to give it to us? <br>
NOG: I didn't say they were going to give it to us. But they might be
willing to trade for it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Trade? For what? <br>
NOG: Depends on what they need and what we have. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I suppose it doesn't hurt to try. But remember, be
discreet. <br>
NOG: Rule of Acquisition one sixty eight, whisper your way to success. <br>
O'BRIEN: Words to live by. <br>
NOG: Chief, one more thing. I need your authorisation code. <br>
O'BRIEN: What for? <br>
NOG: The shipping orders. <br>
O'BRIEN: Bring them to me and I'll authorise them. <br>
NOG: I just thought it would save time. When did you say the Captain
was going to be back? <br>
(O'Brien signs the PADD with a sigh.) <br>

ODO: Staring at me. <br>
WEYOUN: Was I? I didn't mean to. <br>
ODO: You've been doing it for the last ten hours. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm sorry. It's just such an honour to be sitting here with a

ODO: We're being hailed. <br>

ODO: I'm trying. <br>
(Too late.) <br>
WEYOUN7 [on monitor]: Founder. It's an honour to speak with you once
again. You look surprised to see me, Odo. <br>
ODO: I'm well aware the Vorta are all clones, but I'm not sure the
universe is ready for two Weyouns. <br>
WEYOUN7 [on monitor]: I couldn't agree more. <br>
ODO [on monitor]: So which of you is the Weyoun I've had the misfortune
of dealing with over the past few years? <br>
WEYOUN: Actually, neither of us. <br>
WEYOUN7 [on monitor]: That was Weyoun Five. Our illustrious predecessor
was killed a month ago. <br>
WEYOUN: And I had the honour of replacing him. <br>

unfortunate. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Runabout Rio Grande]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: What implant? <br>
WEYOUN: Like all Vorta, I have a termination implant in my brain stem. <br>
WEYOUN7 [on monitor]: Prove your loyalty to the Founders. Activate it. <br>
WEYOUN: The only Founder I'm loyal to is Odo, and he wants me alive. <br>
DAMAR [on monitor]: I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason
with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not.
That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. <br>
WEYOUN7: Founder, there's really no need for you to be involved in this
petty dispute. If you'll just hold your position until one of our ships
can reach you <br>
ODO: I have no intention of releasing my prisoner to you. <br>
WEYOUN7 [on monitor]: If you don't, I can't be responsible for the
consequences. <br>
WEYOUN: That's an empty threat. He wouldn't dare harm a Founder. <br>
DAMAR [on monitor]: Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape
shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
WEYOUN: Forgive me, Odo I should've told you the truth about myself. <br>
ODO: Well, it's not too late to start. Why did you defect? <br>
WEYOUN: It's simple really. From the moment I was activated, I felt
this war was wrong. Please don't misunderstand me, I still worship the
Founders, but I believe their obsession with conquering the Alpha
Quadrant is misguided. It's time they learned to live in peace with the
Solids. I know it's not my place to question the Founders. Maybe Weyoun
Seven is right. I am defective. <br>
ODO: On the contrary. What you're saying about the war, about the
Founders, makes perfect sense. <br>
WEYOUN: I want to thank you, Odo, for the way you stood up for me,
protected me. <br>
ODO: Well don't let it go to your head. I'd do the same for any
prisoner. <br>
WEYOUN: Of course you would. You're a god.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dominion briefing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEYOUN7: To think a Weyoun could be capable of such
treachery. <br>
DAMAR: I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we
met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. <br>
WEYOUN7: He's a disgrace to me and all Vorta. Though I suppose he can't
be held completely responsible for his behaviour. The Vorta cloning
process is a very delicate one. Every once in a while a clone is found
to be defective. It's never happened to a Weyoun before, but it does
happen. And speaking of treachery, there is still the little matter of
the death of Weyoun Five. <br>
DAMAR: You really believe I had something to do with that? <br>
WEYOUN7: You were supposed to be on that transporter pad with him. <br>
DAMAR: I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. <br>
WEYOUN7: How convenient. <br>
DAMAR: I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass
of kanar? <br>
WEYOUN7: I'm afraid our problems won't be washed away quite that
easily. <br>
DAMAR: I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't
possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. <br>
WEYOUN7: But what if he refuses to hand over his prisoner? <br>
DAMAR: Then he'll die. <br>
WEYOUN7: He will not. We can't kill a Founder. I forbid it. <br>
DAMAR: Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back
to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all
you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means,
don't you? <br>
WEYOUN7: It means we could lose the war. <br>
DAMAR: That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has
risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of
our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to
spare the life of one Shape shifter. <br>
WEYOUN7: I don't believe the Jem'Hadar would want to fire on Odo, even
if they were ordered to. <br>
DAMAR: They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to
destroy the runabout. <br>
WEYOUN7: I suppose it could work. But if the Founders ever found out
that we were responsible for Odo's death. <br>
DAMAR: Who's going to tell them? <br>
WEYOUN7: Odo doesn't even consider himself a Founder. <br>
DAMAR: Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I
really think you should try a little kanar.

NOG: No, in the Great Material Continuum. <br>
O'BRIEN: Who are they? <br>
NOG: It's not a they, it's the force that binds the universe together. <br>
O'BRIEN: I must have missed that class in Engineering School. <br>
NOG: On Ferenginar, we learn about the Continuum while we still have
our first set of ears. <br>
O'BRIEN: This is no time for Ferengi fairy tales. <br>
NOG: The Continuum is real. You see, there are millions upon millions
of worlds in the universe, each one filled with too much of one thing
and not enough of another. And the Great Continuum flows through them
all like a mighty river, from have to want and back again. And if we
navigate the Continuum with skill and grace, our ship will be filled
with everything our hearts desire. <br>
O'BRIEN: Right now, I'd settle for a stabiliser and the Captain's desk.

WEYOUN: But the Jem'Hadar would never obey an order to harm a Founder. <br>
ODO: Maybe they finally got it through their head that I'm not a
Founder. <br>
WEYOUN: Or they don't know who they're firing at. We've got to let them
know you're on board. <br>
ODO: They're jamming all the frequencies. I can't get through. <br>
WEYOUN: They've been ordered not to communicate with us. <br>
ODO: Damar said he was determined not to let us get back to the
station. <br>
WEYOUN: See if you can get above them. <br>
ODO: Why? <br>
WEYOUN: I'll explain later. Just do it. <br>
(Rio Grande lets the Jem'Hadar pass underneath.) <br>
ODO: What now? <br>
WEYOUN: Lock phasers on their dorsal field junction. Their shields are
weakest there. <br>
(A sustained phaser burst and KaBOOM!) <br>
ODO: Well, congratulations. You just saved our lives. <br>
WEYOUN: And murdered loyal servants of the Dominion. May the Founders
forgive me. <br>
ODO: Has it ever occurred to you that the reason you believe the
Founders are gods is because that's what they want you to believe? That
they built that into your genetic code? <br>
WEYOUN: Of course they did. That's what gods do. After all, why be a
god if there's no one to worship you? </font></p>

O'BRIEN: Who gave him permission to use a runabout? <br>

O'BRIEN: I never should've given him my authorisation code. Did he say

WEYOUN7: Isn't it obvious? My predecessor must have helped Odo get past
the ship's defences. <br>
DAMAR: Then how do we stop them? <br>
WEYOUN7: How else? Send more ships. Send a whole battalion if
necessary, from our base at Olmerak. <br>
DAMAR: Consider it done. <br>
WEYOUN7: Remember to tell them to fire on sight. <br>
FOUNDER: Fire at whom? <br>
WEYOUN7: Founder, how may I serve you? <br>
FOUNDER: By answering my question. <br>
DAMAR: We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the
Olmerak system. <br>
FOUNDER: Surely one ship shouldn't be much of a threat. <br>
WEYOUN7: We'll have it destroyed within the hour. <br>
(Her face looks dry and wrinkled.) <br>
DAMAR: Are you feeling all right? <br>
FOUNDER: Why do you ask? <br>
DAMAR: Your face. <br>
(She morphs the wrinkles away.) <br>
FOUNDER: I'm fine. But from now on, I want the temperature in these
rooms lowered by fifteen degrees. I do not share the Cardassians' love
of heat. <br>
WEYOUN7: Nor do I. Lower the temperature. <br>
DAMAR: As you wish. <br>
WEYOUN7: Is there anything else I can do for you? <br>
FOUNDER: Have you located Weyoun Six? <br>
WEYOUN7: It's only a matter of time. <br>
FOUNDER: So you keep saying. <br>
WEYOUN7: I assure you, Founder. He will be dealt with. <br>

WEYOUN7: You heard her. These rooms are too hot. <br>
DAMAR: I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. <br>
WEYOUN7: She's not the Founder you should be worried about. Contact
Olmerak and order those ships to intercept the runabout. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Weyoun uses a chopstick to spear a piece of salami
from a pizza.) <br>
WEYOUN: That was filling. <br>
ODO: I would hope so. You sampled the replicator's entire menu. <br>
WEYOUN: I enjoyed the different textures. <br>
ODO: You mean tastes, don't you? <br>
WEYOUN: Not at all. The Vorta sense of taste is quite limited. About
the only foods we really enjoy are kava nuts and rippleberries. <br>
ODO: Ah. I take it this is also a result of your genetic programming? <br>
WEYOUN: It's the Founders' way of making sure we remember our past. You
must know the story of how the Founders created the Vorta? <br>
ODO: No, but I have the feeling you're going to tell me all about it. <br>
WEYOUN: The Vorta used to be quite different from what we are today. We
were forest dwellers. Small, timid, ape-like creatures living in
hollowed out trees. <br>
ODO: Eating nuts and berries. <br>
WEYOUN: And living in fear of the many predators that would hunt us for
food. One day, a wounded changeling came stumbling through the forest
fleeing from a mob of angry solids. <br>
ODO: Why were they chasing him? <br>
WEYOUN: What does it matter? Solids have always feared and distrusted
shape-shifters, you know that. Well, a family of Vorta hid the
changeling from his pursuers. And in return for saving his life, the
changeling promised the Vorta that one day we would be transformed into
powerful beings. That we would become an important part of a great new
empire that would stretch across the Galaxy. <br>
ODO: And the changeling kept his word. <br>
WEYOUN: That's right. Imagine, Odo. My people were once little more
than apes, and look at us now. Look at what you've done for us. <br>
ODO: If the story were true, it would at least prove that my people are
capable of generosity and kindness. <br>
WEYOUN: You care about your people very much, don't you, Odo? In spite
of all that's happened between you. <br>
ODO: Maybe I do, but that doesn't change the fact that they're
responsible for a war that's killed millions. <br>
WEYOUN: Odo, there's something you need to know. A sickness has spread
throughout the Great Link. The Founders are dying. I was summoned to a
meeting by the female changeling. She wanted to discuss troop
deployments with me, and suddenly her hands began to shrivel. It lasted
only a second or two, but over the last few weeks, it's happened a
number of times. It's like she's withering. <br>
ODO: And you're sure the other changelings are also infected? <br>
WEYOUN: She said the entire Link is suffering from the disease. <br>
ODO: Everyone but me. <br>
WEYOUN: If they're unable to find a cure, you'll be the last of your
kind. <br>
ODO: Why didn't you tell me this earlier? <br>
WEYOUN: Because I knew how much it would hurt you. I'm sorry to bring
you such sad news. But at least you're not infected. The Dominion will
survive. <br>
ODO: Meaning what? <br>
WEYOUN: Think about it, Odo. You have an opportunity to rectify the
mistakes your people have made. To build a new Dominion based on
cooperation, not conquest. On peace, not war. A new order under your
leadership. <br>
ODO: And what's your role going to be in this new order? <br>
WEYOUN: Whatever you want it to be. I wish only to serve you. <br>
(Alarm.) <br>
ODO: All right, and you can start by telling me how one runabout is
going to survive an assault by four Jem'Hadar ships. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm sure you'll think of something. <br>
ODO: There's a Kuiper Belt not far from here. We might be able to hide
among the comet fragments. But we don't have much time. They're closing
fast. <br>
(They dodge in amongst the icy boulders.) <br>
WEYOUN: These comet fragments are nothing but huge chunks of ice. The
Jem'Hadar will have no trouble finding us. <br>
ODO: Not if we become the ice. <br>
(The runabout flies into a crevasse and through to a cave.) <br>
ODO: Well, with the power off and the runabout in thermal contact with
the ice, we won't generate enough of an energy signature for their
sensors to read. <br>
WEYOUN: We become the ice. Only a god could think of such a thing. <br>
ODO: Well let's just hope the Jem'Hadar give up their search before we
freeze to death. <br>
WEYOUN: My faith will keep me warm. <br>
ODO: Perhaps. But in an hour you may want to trade in that faith for a
thermal blanket.
