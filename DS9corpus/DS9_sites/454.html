ODO: Too hot? <br>
KIRA: A little. <br>
ODO: Why don't you specify a lower temperature? <br>
KIRA: No, no, no. Coffee should be a little too hot to drink right
away. <br>
ODO: Why? <br>
KIRA: It slows down the experience, gives you time to savour the taste.
<br>
ODO: Ah, yes, taste. <br>
KIRA: Odo, I know you don't need to eat but did you ever try anyway? <br>
ODO: Once, not long after I was first able to assume the humanoid form.
<br>
KIRA: And? <br>
ODO: And since I don't have taste buds, it was very unsatisfying. Not
to mention messy. <br>
KIRA: Messy? <br>
ODO: I'd rather not talk about it. <br>
TIRON: Major Kira, how nice to see you again. <br>

KIRA: Tiron. <br>
TIRON: You left Quark's last night just when I was about to buy
everyone another round. I was devastated that you didn't say goodbye.
We were having such a pleasant conversation. <br>
KIRA: As I recall, you were the one doing all the talking. <br>
TIRON: Well in that case you have me at a disadvantage. You know all
about me, and I know next to nothing about you. <br>
ODO: Er, perhaps I should be going. <br>
KIRA: Oh, no. Stay. This is Tiron, a business associate of Quark's.
This is Odo, my lover. <br>
TIRON: Well, you're a very lucky man. <br>
KIRA: I'm a lucky woman. <br>
ODO: Yes, we're both very lucky. <br>
TIRON: And you make a most interesting couple. So, Mister Odo, what is
it that you do? <br>
ODO: I'm Chief of Security on this station. <br>
TIRON: Oh. A station this size, it must be a very challenging job. I
hope you're well compensated? <br>
KIRA: Oh, money doesn't matter. All we need is each other. Isn't that
right, sweetheart? <br>
ODO: Yes, sweetheart. <br>
KIRA: You see? Money isn't everything. <br>
TIRON: Oh no. But it can buy everything. Well, I'm afraid I must be
going. Goodbye. <br>
(Tiron leaves) <br>
KIRA: Oh, good riddance. Thank you, Odo. I wish you'd been around last
night. I'd better get back to Ops. See you later, sweetheart.

continuing threat posed by the Dominion, I've convinced Starfleet that
we must continue our exploration of the Gamma Quadrant.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I've run a preliminary analysis of our
sensor sweeps, and the second planet in the Kylata system is definitely
M-class. <br>
DAX: I wish we'd had time to beam down to the surface and take a closer
look. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd hate to have run into a Jem'Hadar patrol while we were
down there picking flowers. <br>
SISKO: Fortunately there's no sign of any Dominion activity in this
sector. <br>
BASHIR: Let's hope it stays that way. <br>
DAX: I'm picking up very unusual gravimetric distortions in the Trialus
system. <br>
SISKO: Any idea what's causing them? <br>
DAX: It's hard to tell at this range. <br>
SISKO: Let's take a closer look. <br>
(Later) <br>
O'BRIEN: The system's coming into visual range. <br>
SISKO: On screen. <br>
DAX: The gravimetric distortions are intensifying but they don't seem
to be coming from the star itself. <br>
O'BRIEN: Where else could they be coming from? There aren't any planets
in this system. <br>
(Shudder, and a planet appears right in front of them.) <br>
DAX: There are now <br>
(After the titles) <br>
DAX: The planet seems to have settled into a stable orbit. <br>
BASHIR: Where did it come from? <br>
SISKO: Could the entire planet have been cloaked? <br>
O'BRIEN: If it was, there should be residual ionization traces but I'm
not reading any. <br>
DAX: Commander, we're being scanned. The beam is coming from a
settlement on the southern hemisphere. I'm reading approximately thirty
humanoid inhabitants. They seem to be the only humanoids on the planet.
<br>
O'BRIEN: They're hailing us. <br>
SISKO: Open a channel. I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko of the Federation
Starbase Deep Space Nine. <br>
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: (a woman) I am Seltin Rakal of Meridian. <br>
SISKO: We were studying this star system when your planet appeared. <br>
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: I expect it must have come as something of a
surprise. <br>
SISKO: Well, you could say that. It seemed to come out of nowhere. <br>
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: Not nowhere, Commander, but a dimension that
intersects with this one. I could explain more in detail, if you're
interested. We were just about to sit down for First Meal. Why don't
you join us? <br>
SISKO: We'd like that. I just need to know your planet is not going to
disappear in the middle of dessert. <br>
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: Don't worry. We'll be here for a while.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The small settlement is surrounded by lush forest.
Everyone is sitting on the ground around a low horseshoe-shaped table) <br>
SELTIN: It's good to be together again around this table after so long.
What's more, we're fortunate to have visitors to share First Meal with
us. <br>
DERAL: I was admiring your markings. Are they decorative? <br>
DAX: No. Are yours? <br>
DERAL: No. If you don't mind my asking, how far down do they go? <br>
DAX: All the way. <br>
SELTIN: You're not eating, Commander. <br>
SISKO: I guess my curiosity is bigger than my appetite. <br>
SELTIN: I hope we can satisfy both. <br>
SISKO: Well, you were saying Meridian emerged from a dimension that
intersects with this one? <br>
SELTIN: Yes. You see, our planet has a dual existence. It shifts
between this dimension and another. <br>
DAX: What causes these shifts? <br>
SELTIN: Well we're not entirely sure. Deral has been studying the
phenomenon. <br>
DERAL: With only limited success, I'm afraid. My theory is that the
dimensional shifts are caused by fluctuations in Meridian's quantum
matrix. Fluctuations that are somehow triggered by our own sun. <br>
BASHIR: What's it like, this dimension of yours? <br>
SELTIN: It's hard to explain. It's without form. We exist as pure
consciousness <br>
SISKO: And Meridian? <br>
SELTIN: It becomes non-corporeal as well, but when we return to this
dimension, everything is just as we left it. The buildings, the trees,
even our bodies. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you saying that when you return here, it's as if no time
has passed? <br>
SELTIN: We only age when we're in corporeal form. <br>
BASHIR: Sounds like this other dimension has its advantages. <br>
DERAL: Yes, but we always look forward to this existence and its many
pleasures. Here, let me help you with that. <br>
(Deral takes the fruit that Dax is trying to get into.) <br>
DERAL: The trick is to scoop out the pulp and eat the thin layer inside
the rind. Here, try some. <br>
DAX: It's delicious. <br>
DERAL: Especially if you've been looking forward to it for sixty years.
<br>
DAX: Sixty years? <br>
O'BRIEN: That's a long time between meals.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TIRON: A glass of Andorian ale. <br>
QUARK: Done so soon? You were barely in the holosuite ten minutes. <br>
TIRON: There was no reason for me to stay the full hour. <br>
QUARK: I understand. It's a very effective programme. <br>
TIRON: On the contrary. I found it quite dull. Boring, boring, boring. <br>
QUARK: I'm sorry to hear you say that, but if you're asking for a
refund, forget it. The contract specifically says that satisfaction is
not guaranteed. But for a valued customer such as yourself, I'll make
an exception and allow you try a different programme. No extra charge.
Let's see. Something a little bit more unique. Oh, I have just the
thing. A picnic with the Pleasure Goddess of Rixx. I can even provide
real food for a small fee, of course. <br>
TIRON: I don't like picnics, Quark, and the food here is abominable. <br>
QUARK: Forget the food. Believe me, you've never had a picnic like this
one. <br>
TIRON: What I want is not in your catalogue. <br>
QUARK: Well, tell me what it is and I'll order it for you. It may take
some time, but if it exists I'll get it. <br>
TIRON: That's just the point, Quark. The programme I want doesn't
exist. Not yet, anyway. <br>
QUARK: A custom programme? It'll be expensive. <br>
(Tiron takes a large piece of gold-pressed latinum from his sleeve.) <br>
QUARK: For that kind of money you can move into a holosuite. Now, what
is it you want? <br>
TIRON: I want Major Kira. <br>
QUARK: Kira? What are you going to do with Kira in a holosuite? No,
don't tell me. I don't want to know. <br>
TIRON: Can you do it? <br>
QUARK: It isn't going to be easy. I'd have to get her into the
holosuite and record her image, and she hates holosuites. <br>
TIRON: Spare me the details. Do we have a deal, or do I take my
business elsewhere? <br>
QUARK: Consider it done. Now I'll just keep this <br>
TIRON: Payment on delivery, and not a moment sooner. Don't disappoint
me, Quark. When I walk into that holosuite and I see Kira standing
there, I'd better believe it's really her. <br>
QUARK: Leave it to me. (Tiron leaves) The things I do for money. </font></p>

with a small pond. <br>
DAX: It sounds lovely. <br>
DERAL: It is. <br>
DAX: Deral, our scans showed that there are only about thirty of you on
this entire planet <br>
DERAL: There were never many of us. We're the descendants of an
expedition that was stranded here millennia ago. <br>
DAX: And your population hasn't increased since then? <br>
DERAL: It did for a time, but over the last few centuries our numbers
have dwindled. You see, we only reproduce when we're in humanoid form,
and our time here keeps growing shorter. In twelve days, Meridian will
shift back to its non-corporeal state. <br>
DAX: And remain there for the next sixty years. <br>
DERAL: Eventually we will only be here for a matter of minutes. When
that happens Meridian will too unstable to successfully shift back to
the other dimension. <br>
DAX: And then what happens? <br>
DERAL: The planet and all its inhabitants will cease to exist in either
dimension. <br>
(On the other side of the square.) <br>
SELTIN: We deeply appreciate your offer of help, Commander. <br>
SISKO: If there is a way to stabilise the dimensional shifts, we'll do
everything we can to find it. <br>
SELTIN: That's all we can ask. <br>

SISKO: Maybe later. <br>

Ladies and gentlemen, Major Kira Nerys! <br>

QUARK: This is a special occasion. An event like this only happens once
in a bar owner's lifetime. Let me tell you about your prizes. <br>
KIRA: You mean I won something? <br>
QUARK: Of course you won something, it's part of the celebration. <br>
KIRA: I've never won anything before. <br>
QUARK: Well, now you have. Congratulations. <br>
KIRA: Are you really serious about this. <br>
QUARK: My customers are my livelihood, Major. This is a chance for me
to give something back to them. Now, let's see what we have for you. A
bottle of Kandora champagne, vintage twenty three sixty eight. That's a
very good year. These are good for five free spins at the dabo wheel
and last but not least, one free hour in a holosuite with the programme
of your choice. <br>
KIRA: A visit to a holosuite? <br>
QUARK: Offer good today only. <br>
KIRA: That's perfect. <br>
QUARK: Right this way. <br>
KIRA: It's Ensign Quintana's birthday. He'd love a free trip to the
holosuite. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: These are the Defiant's sensor readings from
when we first entered this system. Take a look at the spectral scan. <br>
SISKO: It indicates that your sun was giving off modulated gamma bursts
right before Meridian appeared. <br>
DERAL: My people have no record of that phenomenon. <br>
SISKO: That's not surprising, since Meridian was in a non-corporeal
state when it occurred. <br>
DAX: Gamma activity would seem to indicate an anomaly in your sun's
fusion cycle. <br>
SISKO: Let's find out for sure. Chief, I want you to send a probe into
the sun's corona to scan the core. <br>
O'BRIEN: It'll take a minute to modify its shield configuration. <br>
DAX: How do modulated gamma bursts cause a dimensional shift? <br>
DERAL: Do you always do that when you're concentrating? <br>
DAX: Do what? <br>
DERAL: Bite your lower lip. <br>
DAX: I guess I do. <br>

happy to see us leave together. <br>
DERAL: She'd probably prefer if I was walking with Keshara or Renar.
You see, ever since my wife died everyone's been wondering when I was
going to find myself another companion. <br>
DAX: Why haven't you? <br>
DERAL: I guess I was waiting for the right woman to fall out of the
sky. <br>
DAX: That doesn't happen too often. <br>
DERAL: It only had to happen once. Don't worry about Seltin. After all,
we both know this is just a harmless little walk. <br>
DAX: Absolutely. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SELTIN: Deral, we've been looking for you.
Commander Sisko told us the great news. I can't thank you enough for
all you've done. <br>
DAX: I'm glad we were able to help. <br>
SELTIN: The next time Meridian returns here, we'll have thirty years
for our people to get to know each other better. <br>
DERAL: I need to discuss something with you. <br>
SELTIN: Of course. I've called a meeting. Now that we have a future
again, we need to start planning for it. And you need to make some
decisions as well. <br>
DERAL: That's what I want to talk to you about. <br>
SELTIN: The person you need to talk to is Keshara. She's not going to
wait for you forever, you know. <br>
DERAL: I was going to speak to her, as well. <br>
SELTIN: I'm glad. Think of it, Deral. People can start having families
again. Eventually we may have to expand the settlement. As you can see,
Jadzia, we have a great deal of planning to do. Well, I think Iwe've
kept the others waiting long enough. Come, lets get started. <br>
DAX: You'd better go inside. <br>
DERAL: I'll meet you back at the ship.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: You know, the person I feel sorry for is
Quark. He always thought that you and he were made for each other. I
don't suppose he'll be letting you win at tongo anymore. <br>
DAX: What are you talking about? He doesn't let me win. <br>
(Doorbell.) <br>
DAX: Come in. Deral! <br>
DERAL: Well, it's done. I told Seltin and the others that I'm leaving
Meridian. <br>
DAX: What did they say? <br>
DERAL: They asked me not to go. Seltin feels the settlement can't
afford to lose anyone. <br>
DAX: What did you tell her? <br>
DERAL: I told her I understood her concern, but that I've made up my
mind. So what were you two talking about before I interrupted? Not me,
I hope? <br>
BASHIR: Actually, I was just telling Jadzia that she's not as good a
tongo player as she thinks she is. <br>
DERAL: Tongo? <br>
DAX: It's a game. And I'm very good at it. <br>
BASHIR: Now we'll find out on Tuesday night. <br>
DAX: And I want you there to see for yourself. I'm going to clean you
and Quark out. <br>
DERAL: Jadzia, I have to go. <br>
DAX: But you just got here. <br>
DERAL: There are some things I need to take care of before we leave
Meridian. <br>
DAX: Do you need any help? <br>
DERAL: No. I just have to say goodbye to some people. I'll see you
later tonight.

TIRON: And I was thinking about you, and your reputation as a man who
can get anything for a price. <br>
QUARK: Stop, you're embarrassing me. <br>
TIRON: I'll embarrass you even more if you don't get me my programme. <br>
(Quark holds up a rod.) <br>
QUARK: Not to worry. <br>
TIRON: Is that it? <br>
QUARK: No. It's a high-level decryption protocol and I'm going to use
it to get the final information I need for your programme. It cost me
dearly. <br>
TIRON: If it works, it's worth whatever price you paid for it. <br>
QUARK: I was hoping you'd say that. I'll put it on your bill. <br>
TIRON: Fine. Just get me my programme. I'm leaving in two days. <br>
QUARK: You'll have it. And I assure you it'll be well worth the wait.

ODO: Yes. Someone has been illegally accessing the station's personnel
files. Your file, to be exact. <br>
KIRA: Mine? <br>
ODO: They've downloaded your voiceprint, your retinal scan, even your
psychiatric profile. I've managed to trace the data-path back to its
source. <br>
KIRA: Well, let me guess. Quark. <br>
ODO: Was there any doubt? <br>
KIRA: With all this information he'd have no problem generating a
holo-image of me. <br>
ODO: So, shall I arrest him, or would you prefer to do it yourself? <br>
KIRA: No. I have a better idea. Can you spare a few hours? I'd like to
prepare a little surprise for Quark.

massage from Dax.) <br>
DAX: You see, the key to tongo is to confront when you're sure you're
in a better position than the other players. And if your cards match
the roll of the dice, then you win. Deral? <br>
DERAL: Go on, I'm listening. <br>
DAX: You haven't heard a word I've been saying, have you? <br>
DERAL: I'm sorry. I just have so much on my mind. <br>
DAX: You don't want to leave Meridian, do you? <br>
DERAL: I said I would and I will. <br>
DAX: I know what you said, but what do you want? <br>
DERAL: To be with you. <br>
DAX: But you're worried about your people. <br>
DERAL There are so few of us, Jadzia, and now that Meridian has a
future again, they need me. <br>
DAX: Then you have to stay. <br>
DERAL: And lose you? No. <br>
DAX: What if you didn't have to lose me? What if I stayed here with
you? <br>
DERAL: I wish you could but that's not possible. Your molecular
structure wouldn't survive the dimensional shift. <br>
DAX: We could use the transporter buffer to match my quantum matrix to
yours. <br>
DERAL: But how do you know that's possible? <br>
DAX: Because I discussed it with Julian after you left my quarters. <br>
DERAL: Jadzia. Are you sure you're willing to do that? <br>
DAX: It's the only way we can be together and I don't want to lose you,
either.

SISKO: I bet this is the first time anyone's ever requested a sixty
year leave. <br>
DAX: You'll be sure that it gets to them? <br>
SISKO: If you're sure that this is what you really want. <br>
DAX: What I really want is for you to say you're happy for me. <br>
SISKO: I guess I just need to know that you have thought this thing
through. If Curzon had told me he wanted to go off with some woman he'd
just met, I would've tried to talk him out of it too. <br>
DAX: And you would have been right. He fell in love with someone new
every other week. But I'm not Curzon. <br>
SISKO: No, and I've never seen Jadzia do anything without thinking it
through first. I am happy for you. It's just I'm going to miss you, old
man. <br>
DAX: You've been my friend for two lifetimes. I can't imagine what it's
going to be like not having you around. Leaving Deep Space Nine is the
hardest thing I have ever done but I know it's right. Besides, after
eight lifetimes as a humanoid, existing as pure consciousness might be
interesting. <br>
