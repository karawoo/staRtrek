WORF [OC]: Worf to Major Kira. <br>
KIRA: This is Kira.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Major, you've got an incoming transmission
from a Razka Karn. He claims to be an old friend.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Put him through. Razka. It's been a while.
How's business? <br>
RAZKA [on monitor]: Oh, let's just say I miss the old days on Bajor.
Smuggling might not have been the safest line of work, but it was a lot
more exciting than selling scrap metal. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0110735/" target="_blank"> Roy
Brocksmith</a>, previously seen as Kolrami in <a href="../NextGen/147.htm"> Peak
Performance</a>) <br>
KIRA: What's on your mind, Razka? <br>
RAZKA [on monitor]: I picked up a lead on the Ravinok. <br>
KIRA: Like the last time? <br>
RAZKA [on monitor]: Last time it was just a rumour. This time I have
evidence, a fragment of metal. Looks like it's part of the forward
sensor array. <br>
KIRA: Can you bring it to Deep Space Nine for analysis? <br>
RAZKA [on monitor]: Sorry. I'm afraid I can't leave the Badlands right
now. Important business. You understand. <br>
KIRA: Tholians are after you again? <br>
RAZKA [on monitor]: Let's just say it'd be better if you came to me. <br>
KIRA: It's been six years. Even if you have found a piece of the
Ravinok, it doesn't mean there are any survivors. <br>
RAZKA [on monitor]: There's only one way for you to find out. I'll be
waiting.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: And item number seventeen, Trelos Vren was
arrested on the Promenade outside of the Klingon restaurant. He's being
held on four counts of petty theft. <br>
KIRA: Trelos Vren? Where have I heard that name? <br>
ODO: We arrested him once for attempting to break into the assay
office. <br>
KIRA: And now he's taken up pickpocketing? <br>
ODO: Without much success. Still, I suppose you should admire him for
his persistence. That was a joke. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry, Odo. I may have a lead on the Ravinok. I know what
you're going to say. It's been six years since the Ravinok disappeared.
Odds are everyone on board is dead. <br>
ODO: That all may be true, but that is not what I was going to say. I
was going to say good luck. <br>
KIRA: Good luck? <br>
ODO: You had a friend aboard the Ravinok, correct? <br>
KIRA: Lorit Akrem. <br>
ODO: Which means it doesn't matter if I think there are any survivors,
or even if you think there are any survivors. You are going to go
looking for that ship, and all I can say is good luck. And I hope you
find them.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kira is packing when the doorbell rings.) <br>
KIRA: Come in. Captain. You here to see me off? <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid not. I'd like you to postpone your trip for at least
for a day or two. <br>
KIRA: What's wrong? <br>
SISKO: Somehow the Cardassian government got wind of your plan to
search for the Ravinok. They've asked permission to send someone with
you. <br>
KIRA: And you said yes? <br>
SISKO: I said I'd talk to you about it. The Ravinok was a Cardassian
ship. <br>
KIRA: Carrying Bajoran prisoners. I'm not stopping anyone else from
looking. I just don't see why they have to come with me. <br>
SISKO: The request came directly from the leader of the new civilian
government. Nerys, I know this isn't what you had in mind, but Bajor
and Cardassia must to learn to work together and that means cooperating
on missions like these. <br>
KIRA: All right. Just tell them I'm not going to wait forever. If their
representative isn't here within fifty two hours, I'm going alone. <br>
SISKO: I'll be sure they get the message.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: So did you and Kasidy have a nice time last
night? <br>
SISKO: I just wish she wasn't leaving tomorrow. <br>
DAX: It sounds like the two of you are getting serious. <br>
SISKO: I don't know about that. I don't think Kasidy is looking to get
serious. <br>
KASIDY: Ben! <br>
SISKO: Kasidy. <br>
DAX: We were just talking about you. <br>
KASIDY: I don't mean to interrupt. I wanted you to know I won't be
leaving tomorrow after all. <br>
SISKO: That's good news. I mean, that's great. How long are you going
to be here? <br>
KASIDY: That depends on whether I get this new job or not. I've applied
for a position with the Bajoran Ministry of Commerce to captain one of
their freighters. <br>
SISKO: You're going to work for the Bajorans? <br>
KASIDY: If we can hammer out an agreement. It's a terrific opportunity.
I get to use my own ship, pick my own crew, and the best part is, I
never have to leave this sector. <br>
DAX: Where're you going to live? <br>
KASIDY: On my ship, I suppose. <br>
DAX: Well, why don't you stay here? I'm sure that Benjamin could
arrange for some quarters. <br>
KASIDY: That's not a bad idea. <br>
SISKO: Yeah. <br>
KASIDY: Well, I have a meeting on Bajor and the shuttle leaves in a few
minutes. I'll see you tonight? <br>
(Sisko kisses Kasidy and she leaves.) <br>
DAX: That answers that. She's serious.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Captain, the Cardassian transport Rabol is
approaching the station. They're requesting permission to beam their
representative directly to Ops. <br>
KIRA: Someone's in a big hurry. <br>
SISKO: Permission granted. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
(Dukat beams in, carrying a bag) <br>
DUKAT: Ah, Major Kira. I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Runabout]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: We'll be crossing into the Badlands in
approximately six hours. <br>
DUKAT: Very good, Major. <br>
KIRA: Dukat, let's get one thing straight. This is my mission. The only
reason you're here is because I agreed to let you come along. When I
give an order, I expect you to follow it. No questions asked. <br>
DUKAT: Believe me, Major, I want nothing more than for this mission to
be concluded as quickly and as efficiently as possible. I leave the
details in your capable hands. <br>
KIRA: Good, then we shouldn't have any problems. There's one thing I
don't understand. Why did the Cardassian government send you? <br>
DUKAT: The Ravinok was under my general command. Those were my troops
and it is my duty to try to find them. The question is, what are you
doing here, Major? <br>
KIRA: I knew someone aboard the Ravinok. <br>
DUKAT: One of the prisoners, I assume? <br>
KIRA: Lorit Akrem. <br>
DUKAT: I see. So you're on this mission for personal reasons. <br>
KIRA: Is there something wrong with that? <br>
DUKAT: Not at all. I've found that when one is trying to do a difficult
job, personal reasons can be quite an incentive. So who was he? A
family member, a compatriot, a lover? <br>
KIRA: Lorit recruited me into the Shakaar resistance cell. <br>
DUKAT: Ah. The infamous Shakaar resistance. We never could eliminate
that little group of yours. And it was not from lack of trying, I
assure you. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, Major, but I've
always admired you. You are the embodiment of the new Bajor. A Bajoran
born out of the ashes of the occupation, a Bajoran tempered with
Cardassian steel. <br>
KIRA: Captain Sisko's right. You are in love with the sound of your own
voice. <br>
DUKAT: I know you find this to accept, but I believe that in some ways
the Occupation actually helped Bajor. <br>
KIRA: Which part? The massacres or the strip mining? <br>
DUKAT: I have no desire to debate the merits of the Occupation with
you. I'm even willing to admit that perhaps we were a little harsh in
our methods. But the fact is, the Bajoran people are stronger now than
they have been in centuries. When we arrived, you were a weak,
contemplative race, choking on your isolation. And now you have a new
confidence, a whole new sense of purpose, not to mention a key role in
the future of this entire quadrant. <br>
KIRA: All of which Bajor achieved in spite of the Cardassians, not
because of them. <br>
DUKAT: Think what you must, But I believe the time will come when
Cardassia and Bajor will grow to be not only allies but also close
friends. <br>
KIRA: Cardassia and Bajor, maybe. You and me? I doubt it. <br>
DUKAT: All I ask is that you have an open mind. <br>
KIRA: All right, Dukat, that's enough. Now, if you don't mind, I would
like to spend the next six hours in silent meditation. <br>
DUKAT: Is that a request, or an order? <br>
KIRA: Whatever it takes. <br>
DUKAT: Well, in that case, as much as it pains me. <br>
(Dukat shuts his mouth and leans back in his seat.) <br>
KIRA: We both might survive this trip after all.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(At candle-lit dinner.) <br>
KASIDY: They didn't even wait for the interview to be over. After
twenty minutes, Minister Azin said she'd heard enough, and if I wanted
the job, it was mine. <br>
SISKO: So what did you tell them? <br>
KASIDY: What do you think I told them? I said yes. <br>
SISKO: Congratulations. <br>
KASIDY: That's it? <br>
SISKO: Oh. (kisses her) <br>
KASIDY: That's not what I meant. I want to know how you feel about it. <br>
SISKO: I think it's great. We'll see a lot more of each other. <br>
KASIDY: You know, I was thinking about what Dax said. Maybe I should
get quarters on the station. <br>
SISKO: That's a big step. <br>
KASIDY: What does that mean? <br>
SISKO: I just meant it's a big step. <br>
KASIDY: A bad big step, or a good big step? <br>
SISKO: A good one. <br>
KASIDY: Could you muster a little more enthusiasm? <br>
SISKO: I am enthusiastic. I'm proud of you. This job <br>
KASIDY: Forget about the job. I'm talking about us. I tell you I'm
thinking about living on the station and all you can say is, it's a big
step? <br>
SISKO: Oh, I don't think you took it the way I meant it. <br>
KASIDY: I don't think you know what you meant. But I do. You're afraid
of commitment. <br>
SISKO: Who said anything about commitment? <br>
KASIDY: Obviously not you. You know what? Forget the whole thing. I'm
not going to take the job. If you don't want me to stay here, that's
fine with me. <br>
SISKO: Phew. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In the badlands, having rendezvoused with another
ship) <br>
KIRA: How'd you get a hold of this, Razka? <br>
RAZKA: I bought it off a Ferengi scrap metal merchant. <br>
(Dukat scans it) <br>
DUKAT: It appears to be composed of uridium alloy. It's definitely
Cardassian. <br>
KIRA: Can you tell if it's from the Ravinok? <br>
RAZKA: Why didn't you tell me you were bringing him along? <br>
KIRA: Because when we talked, I didn't know I would be. <br>
RAZKA: Too bad. The Maquis would've paid handsomely to get their hands
on him. <br>
DUKAT: And my government would be very happy to get their hands on you.
Razka Karn, if I'm not mistaken. Smuggler, thief, black marketeer.
There are at least twelve outstanding warrants for your arrest on
Cardassia right now. But I suggest we ignore all that and try to
cooperate with one another. <br>
RAZKA: The voice of the new Cardassia, so compassionate, so
understanding. Almost makes you forget that five years ago he was
working Bajorans to death in forced labour camps and shooting anybody
who tried to stop him. Almost makes you forget. <br>
DUKAT: It's from the Ravinok. No doubt about it. <br>
KIRA: Did the Ferengi tell you where he found it? <br>
RAZKA: No, but I was curious so I bribed one of his crewmembers. Turns
out his last trip was to the Dozaria system. <br>
DUKAT: Dozaria. I believe there is one class M planet in that system. <br>
RAZKA: Barely class M. He found that in orbit. <br>
KIRA: Dozaria it is then. Thanks, Razka. I owe you one. <br>
RAZKA: Just let me know what you find out. Lorit was my friend too. <br>
(Later, en route.) <br>
KIRA: I just don't understand how the Ravinok could've gotten so far
off course. Dozaria is light years from where they should have been. <br>
DUKAT: The Central Command always believed that the ship was destroyed
in some kind of escape attempt by the Bajoran prisoners. <br>
KIRA: Maybe. Or they could've had a problem with their navigational
array or run into some kind of subspace anomaly. <br>
DUKAT: Hopefully we'll find the truth. <br>
KIRA: We're entering orbit. <br>
DUKAT: I'm reading severe ionic interference in the planet's
atmosphere. Sensors will be limited, to say the least. <br>
KIRA: I'm picking up a faint magneton signature. It could be residual
radiation from a damaged warp nacelle. <br>
DUKAT: Shall we beam down? <br>
KIRA: I wouldn't advise it. All this ionic interference will scatter
our molecules halfway around the planet. We're going to have to do this
the old fashioned way. <br>
DUKAT: It's going to be a difficult landing. I'll take the controls if
you like. <br>
KIRA: That'll be the day. Going in.

feels wonderful. <br>
KIRA: Only a Cardassian would call this hellhole invigorating. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, I forgot. Compared to us, you Bajorans are a bit fragile,
physiologically speaking, of course. <br>

SISKO: That's all. <br>
BASHIR: You're sure? <br>
SISKO: Positive. <br>
DAX: What do you think, Julian? <br>
BASHIR: It's ambiguous. Definitely open to interpretation. But it
could've been worse. He could have said it's a very big step. <br>
DAX: You didn't say that, did you? <br>
SISKO: I don't think so. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, that's good, anyway. So, what does he do now? <br>
DAX: It's simple. He goes to Kasidy, admits that everything was his
fault, and pledges his undying love. <br>
BASHIR: That sounds a little extreme to me. What if he just tells her
he made a mistake, there had been a misunderstanding, and that he
really would like her to live on the station? <br>
DAX: Could work. Assuming that's what you want. <br>
QUARK: Captain, I would think long and hard before answering. <br>
SISKO: I don't recall asking your opinion, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Well maybe you should. I mean, who knows more about women than
me? <br>
BASHIR: Everyone. <br>
QUARK: You humans. All you want to do is please your women. You want
them to be your friends. But we Ferengi know better. Women are the
enemy and we treat them accordingly. The key is to never let them get
the upper hand. If she says she doesn't see you enough, threaten to see
her even less. If she wants more gifts, take back the ones you've
already given her. It's all about control. <br>
DAX: What if your woman leaves you? <br>
QUARK: That's what holosuites are for. <br>
(Quark leaves) <br>
BASHIR: It's a wonder the Ferengi reproduce at all. <br>
DAX: So, you never answered the question. Do you want her to stay or
not? <br>
SISKO: I appreciate all the advice. I'll let you know how it turns out.
<br>
(Sisko leaves) <br>
BASHIR: So, just between you and me, what do you think about Kasidy
moving onto the station? <br>

DUKAT: First things first. <br>
KIRA: What are you doing? <br>
DUKAT: We need to identify these bodies. <br>
KIRA: I'll help. <br>
DUKAT: No. Our funeral rites are very strict. It would dishonour the
dead for a non-Cardassian to view the remains. <br>
KIRA: There could be Bajorans buried here too. <br>
DUKAT: No doubt. But if memory's correct, Bajorans are much more
concerned with the souls of the dead than they are with the physical
remains. How did Kai Meressa put it? What remains after death is but a
shell, a sign that the pagh has begun its final journey to the
Prophets. Please, Major, don't make this any more difficult for me than
it already is. <br>
KIRA: I have a list of the missing Bajorans. I should be able to
identify them from the family imprints on their earrings. I'll work on
the Ravinok. I should be able to get something from the ship's
computers. <br>
DUKAT: You'll need the command codes. <br>
KIRA: Standard Cardassian military codes from six years ago, right? <br>
DUKAT: Yes. <br>
KIRA: I got them from Bajoran intelligence before we left. <br>

KIRA: Dukat, I was able to reactivate the (sees him sitting) Dukat.
What was her name? I recognise a Bajoran pledge bracelet when I see
one. <br>
DUKAT: Her name was Tora Naprem. You see, Major, you're not the only
one who had a friend aboard that ship. <br>
KIRA: Friend? Is that all she was? I see. Don't worry, Dukat. You're
not the only Cardassian officer who kept a Bajoran mistress. <br>
DUKAT: It wasn't like that. Naprem and I loved each other. <br>
KIRA: The head of the Occupation in love with a Bajoran? <br>
DUKAT: Ironic, isn't it? <br>
KIRA: Did your wife know? <br>
DUKAT: No. And she's never going to find out. Now if you don't mind,
Major, I'd rather not talk about this right now. Here are the earrings
you wanted. <br>
KIRA: If Lorit's dead, he's not buried here. According to the ship's
computers, the Ravinok was attacked by two unidentified warships. The
attackers chased the Ravinok here and must have forced her to
crash-land. <br>
DUKAT: Then the survivors could have been captured and taken away. <br>
KIRA: Or they could still be here somewhere on this planet. <br>
DUKAT: We should go up in the runabout and scan for them from orbit. <br>
KIRA: Too much ionic interference. The sensors would never be able to
pick up their
life signs. There may be another way. In these conditions, tricorder
readings will only be about twelve metres, but that should be enough. <br>
DUKAT: Enough for what? <br>
KIRA: During the occupation, Bajoran resistance fighters carried
subdermal implants of tritonium isotopes. The idea was that if they
were captured, they could activate the implant which would leave a
trail of isotopes so they could be tracked and rescued. I think I have
something. That way. <br>

KIRA: Actually, they've gotten a little worse. Tell me something. <br>
DUKAT: What? <br>
KIRA: Who's Tora Ziyal? When I reactivated the Ravinok's computer, I
downloaded the manifest. There were two civilians on board in addition
to the prisoners and crew. One was your friend, Tora Naprem, and the
other was Tora Ziyal, a thirteen year-old girl. <br>
DUKAT: I suppose you wouldn't believe me if I told you she was Naprem's
sister? <br>
KIRA: Ziyal's a Cardassian name. The way I see it, there's only one
explanation. Ziyal was Naprem's daughter, and you <br>
DUKAT: I was her father. <br>
KIRA: Now I know why you're in such a hurry to find the survivors.
You're hoping that she's still alive and you can rescue her. <br>
DUKAT: Not quite. You see, if my daughter is still alive, I'll have no
choice but to kill her.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Next day, on the march.) <br>
KIRA: You know I'm not going to let you do it. I mean it, Dukat. You
are not going to kill that girl. <br>
DUKAT: Major, why don't you worry about the other survivors and let me
worry about Ziyal. After all, she is my daughter. <br>
KIRA: That's right. She's your daughter. And there is nothing more
important to Cardassians than family. At least that's what your people
are always saying. <br>
DUKAT: I have a wife and seven children. They are my family. They are
the ones I must protect. <br>
KIRA: Well, you should have thought of that before you got involved
with Naprem. <br>
DUKAT: You're right. I should have. But I made a mistake. A mistake I
intend to correct. <br>
KIRA: You don't have to take her back to Cardassia with you. Let me
take her to Bajor. No one has to know that you're her father. <br>
DUKAT: What kind of life would that be for her? Your people have never
exactly welcomed half-Cardassian children into your society. That's why
I sent her and her mother away in the first place. I knew the
Occupation was coming to an end, and that there'd be no place for them
on Bajor or Cardassia. <br>
KIRA: So you sent them to a prison camp. <br>
DUKAT: They were not on their way to a prison camp. The Ravinok was
supposed to rendezvous with a freighter which would take Naprem and
Ziyal to Lissepia, where they could live out their lives in some sort
of peace. <br>
KIRA: I don't understand. If you cared enough to help Ziyal then, how
can you be thinking about killing her now? Why not send her away again?
<br>
DUKAT: Because my position isn't nearly as stable as it once was. By
aligning myself with the new civilian government, I've made many
enemies. Enemies that wouldn't hesitate to use Ziyal against me. <br>
KIRA: Listen to you. It's not your wife or your seven children you're
protecting, it's you. <br>
DUKAT: By protecting myself, I am protecting them. <br>
KIRA: And the only one who suffers is Ziyal. You would kill your own
daughter to save your career. I don't understand you. You said you
loved Naprem. I saw you crying at her grave. <br>
DUKAT: I did love her. And when I bury Ziyal, I'll weep over her grave
just as I wept over her mother's. But that will not stop me from doing
what I have to do. Do you understand? And when the time comes, I
suggest you stay out of my way.

SISKO: Good morning, Jake-o. <br>
JAKE: Morning, dad. <br>
SISKO: So, what's new? <br>
JAKE: Nog and I ran into Kasidy last night over at the Vulcan
restaurant. I guess she's not going to take that job after all. <br>
SISKO: She told you? Did she say why? <br>
JAKE: She said you didn't want her to take it. <br>
SISKO: Look, Jake, sometimes things between men and women can get a
little complicated. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, maybe, but I don't think this is one of those times. It's
pretty simple, Dad. You're scared. <br>
SISKO: What do I have to be afraid of? <br>
JAKE: A lot. Kasidy's willing to make a major change in her life just
to be close to you. If things don't work out, you're going to feel
responsible, and that's scary. <br>
SISKO: You figured out all this by yourself? <br>
JAKE: Actually, I talked with Nog about it. <br>
SISKO: You talked to Nog about my relationship with Kasidy? <br>
JAKE: And we think you have nothing to worry about. If Kasidy wants to
change jobs, that's her decision, not yours. Same thing if she wants to
live on the station. If things don't work out, they don't work out. <br>
SISKO: Have you told any of this to Kasidy? <br>
JAKE: No. Nog and I thought about it, but we thought it would be better
if you told her yourself. <br>
SISKO: I see. <br>
JAKE: So, what's new with you?

(A mineshaft is guarded by humanoids wearing complete body armour and
workers are pushing a wagon inside.) <br>
DUKAT: Breen? What are they doing here? <br>
KIRA: My tricorder's picking up a large concentration of dilithium in
the area. They must be using the survivors of the Ravinok to mine the
ore. <br>
DUKAT: It makes perfect sense. The Breen homeworld is a frozen
wasteland. This place is about fifty degrees too hot for them. <br>
KIRA: You approve of what they're doing? <br>
DUKAT: No, not at all. I do admire their ingenuity. <br>
KIRA: What is it? <br>

Cardassian/Bajoran girl ladling out water to other workers.) <br>
KIRA: It's her. <br>
DUKAT: My daughter. <br>
KIRA: All right. We're going to need some help. I'm going to stay here
and keep an eye on things while you go back to DS Nine for
reinforcements. <br>
DUKAT: I have a better idea. You go back to the station. I'll stay
here. <br>
KIRA: I'm sending you back, Dukat. That's an order. <br>
DUKAT: And I hate to refuse it, but I'm afraid I must. You're welcome
to file an official protest with the Cardassian military when we get
back. <br>
KIRA: There's no way I'm leaving you alone here. <br>
DUKAT: Well, then I suggest we devise a plan to rescue these prisoners
together. You need me, Major. <br>
KIRA: Maybe I do. But if you hurt that girl, I promise I'll kill you.

KIRA: How many Breen guards are there? <br>
HELER: I'm not sure. There are always at least eight in the mines. <br>
KIRA: How many prisoners? <br>
HELER: There're only thirty one of us left. <br>
KIRA: What about Lorit Akrem? Did he make it? <br>
HELER: He died in a cave-in two years ago. You knew him? <br>
KIRA: He was a friend. <br>
DUKAT: (opens his helmet) My condolences, Major, but we don't have time
for this. Tell me where I can find Tora Ziyal. <br>
KIRA: Don't tell him anything. <br>
HELER: He's a Cardassian. I don't understand. <br>

SISKO: All right, a lot nervous. I haven't been in a serious
relationship for a long time, and I didn't expect to be in one anytime
soon. Until I met you. This life I lead, the job I do, that's what got
