EZRI: I suppose you'll want to tell Miles. <br>

EZRI: Because you tell him everything. <br>
BASHIR: True, but you know what? In this case, I'm going to make an
exception. <br>
EZRI: Good. Oh, we really should get up. We don't want the Defiant

EZRI: There's a first time for everything. <br>

Federation territories would fall under my jurisdiction, including
Earth. <br>

BROCA: He may be alive. <br>
FOUNDER: Is this possible? <br>
WEYOUN: I don't see how. We destroyed his ship, his rebel bases. <br>

Every Jem'Hadar and Breen soldier on Cardassia is looking for you. <br>
DAMAR: If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a

use it whenever you want. <br>

BASHIR: You know, the thing of it is, the apoptosis is really just part
of the normal cardiac renewal process. What do you think? <br>
EZRI: I think that after dinner tonight, we should go to Quark's, spend
some time in a holosuite. <br>
BASHIR: Oh. I'd like a trip to Vegas. <br>
EZRI: Actually, I was thinking about the Alamo. <br>
BASHIR: We can't go there. <br>
EZRI: Why not? <br>
BASHIR: Because that's what Miles and I did. But I do have a new
programme. The Battle of Thermopylae. Do you know it? Well, it's about
a force of Spartans led by King Leonidas, who defend a mountain pass
against a vast army of Persians. <br>
EZRI: What happens then? <br>
BASHIR: For two days, the Spartans lead a heroic struggle. <br>
EZRI: Until they're wiped out. <br>
BASHIR: Yes. How'd you know? <br>
EZRI: Lucky guess. I take it we'll be the Spartans? <br>
BASHIR: Fighting to the last man. <br>
EZRI: Just like the Alamo. <br>
BASHIR: Exactly. <br>
EZRI: Have you talked to a counsellor about these annihilation
fantasies? <br>
BASHIR: Do you think I should? <br>
EZRI: I'll set up a session for you tomorrow. <br>
BASHIR: What about tonight? <br>
EZRI: Tonight we defend the pass.

QUARK: Don't worry, it's guaranteed to grow hair within a week. Though
if you ask me, that dome of yours is hairy enough. Besides, hasn't
there been enough change around here already? <br>
KIRA: Quark! You mind explaining this? <br>
QUARK: Oh. That's this week's betting pool. <br>
KIRA: You're taking bets on who's going to be the new Kai? <br>
QUARK: It's a wide open field. Just between you and me, the smart money
is on Vedek Ungtae. <br>
KIRA: Well just between you and me, all bets are off. <br>
QUARK: What are you talking about? <br>
KIRA: As of this moment, betting pools of any kind are illegal on this
station. I catch someone placing a bet, I put you in a holding cell for
fifteen days. Is that clear? <br>
QUARK: Fifteen days! Can I bring my own pillow? <br>
KIRA: Quark. <br>
QUARK: It's clear. It's clear. <br>
KIRA: It better be. <br>
(Kira leaves. Quark goes back to Morn.) <br>
QUARK: It's like I said. The more things change, the more they stay the
same.
