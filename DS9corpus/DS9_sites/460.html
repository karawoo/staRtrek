<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Those orbital sensor platforms should give
the colonists plenty of advanced warning in case the Cardassians ever
decide to violate the new treaty. <br>
ODO: Hopefully. <br>
KIRA: How did your meeting with Security Chief Bemar go? <br>
ODO: Fine. <br>
KIRA: Was he properly impressed by the depth of your expertise? <br>
ODO: Huh. <br>
KIRA: Odo, is something bothering you? <br>
ODO: What makes you say that? <br>
KIRA: Well for one thing, you haven't said five words to me since we
left Prophet's Landing. <br>
ODO: Huh. <br>
KIRA: Look, if I've done something to offend you, I wish you'd tell me
what it is. <br>
ODO: It's not important. <br>
KIRA: Whatever you say. <br>
ODO: It's certainly not worth making an issue about. <br>
KIRA: Well, glad to hear it. <br>
ODO: It's just (pause) When Governor Avesta invited us to dinner at his
house <br>
KIRA: Go on. <br>
ODO: You said no. <br>
KIRA: And? <br>
ODO: You never bothered to ask me if I wanted to go. <br>
KIRA: You wanted to go to the governor's house for dinner? <br>
ODO: Not particularly. <br>
KIRA: Well then, what's the problem? <br>
ODO: The problem is you never asked what I wanted. <br>
KIRA: Odo, you don't eat. Besides, you hate socialising with people you
don't know. <br>
ODO: Well that's beside the point. I would have liked to have been
consulted, that's all. <br>
KIRA: You're right. Next time we are invited out for dinner, I'll make
sure you are the one to say no. <br>
ODO: I'd appreciate that. <br>
KIRA: Hold on. I'm picking up a wide band subspace transmission from a
Lissepian supply ship. They've just been attacked by a Maquis
interceptor. <br>
ODO: Long range sensors are detecting a modified Peregrine class
courier ship, lightly armed, one man crew, bearing two six eight mark
three oh one. <br>
KIRA: The Maquis use Peregrine class courier ships. The Lissepians
didn't sustain any serious damage. I'm going after him. <br>
ODO: Right. <br>
(After the opening titles.) <br>
KIRA: I don't know what the Maquis have done to that ship's engines,
but it's fast. <br>
ODO: Not fast enough. We're closing on him. <br>
KIRA: We'd better catch him soon. We're entering the Badlands. <br>
ODO: Wait a minute, I've lost him. The Badlands' plasma fields are
disrupting our sensors. <br>
KIRA: Increase the sensor bandwidth. That should compensate for the
interference. <br>
ODO: I hope you're right. <br>
KIRA: He can't have gotten far. He's got to somewhere in this solar
system. <br>
ODO: There he is. It looks like he's trying to land on one of the moons
orbiting that gas giant. <br>
KIRA: I'm following him in. <br>
ODO: Something's wrong with his ship. It looks like his attitude
stabilisers have failed. <br>
KIRA: Can you get a transporter lock on him? <br>
ODO: Too much interference. He's trying to land on that moon. We've
lost him. <br>
KIRA: Did he make it? <br>
ODO: I don't know. Something in the moon's atmosphere is jamming our
sensors. <br>
KIRA: Then I guess we'll have to land and see for ourselves.

allowing me to speak with you. <br>
SISKO: You're welcome. Now, what is this all about? <br>

SISKO: Congratulations. <br>
NOG: Thank you. <br>
SISKO: But that doesn't explain this. <br>
NOG: According to Ferengi by-laws, section one oh five, subparagraph
ten, upon reaching adulthood, Ferengi males must purchase an
apprenticeship from a suitable role model. I choose you. <br>
SISKO: You want to be my apprentice? <br>
NOG: That's right. I want to be the first Ferengi in Starfleet. Now,
who do I see about getting a uniform? <br>
SISKO: Nog, if you want to become a Starfleet Officer, you have to
attend the Academy. <br>
NOG: All right. Where do I sign up? <br>
SISKO: It's not that simple. As a non-Federation citizen, you need a
letter of reference from a command level officer before you can even
take the entrance exam. <br>
NOG: A command level officer? You mean, like you? <br>
SISKO: Well, yes. Like me. <br>
NOG: Then you'll write the letter. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: The tricorders are useless. The atmospheric
ionisation is jamming their transponders. <br>
KIRA: You're sure he's in these caverns? <br>
ODO: Well, he wasn't in the wreckage of his ship. And given the weather
conditions on the surface, there's no way anyone could survive out
there for very long, so that leaves <br>
(moonquake) <br>
KIRA: That's the third quake since we got here. This moon must be
seismically unstable. <br>
ODO: The sooner we find our fugitive, the better off we'll be. <br>
KIRA: Finding him isn't going to be easy. These caverns could go on
forever. With all this seismic activity, I don't want to stay here any
longer than we have to. I say we split up. We meet back here in twenty
minutes, and if we haven't found him by then, we may have to leave
without him. <br>
ODO: If he's smart, he'll let us find him. A Federation prison would be
paradise compared to this place. <br>

(He spins round to see Kira sitting on a boulder.) <br>
ODO: What's wrong? <br>
KIRA: You're not going to believe this. My foot is stuck. <br>
ODO: Stuck? How? <br>
KIRA: I don't know. I must've stepped in a fissure or something. I
can't get it loose. <br>
ODO: Let me take a look. <br>
(Kira's foot is covered in a rock that expands as Odo reaches for it.) <br>
ODO: It's not a fissure. <br>
KIRA: Then what is it? <br>
ODO: Your foot's been encased in some kind of crystal. And from the
look of things the crystal is spreading. <br>
(moonquake) <br>
ODO: Now you're sure you can't pull it loose? <br>
KIRA: Oh, believe me, I've tried. <br>
ODO: Maybe if you slip your foot out of your boot. <br>
KIRA: I can barely feel my foot. The crystal is pressing against it so
hard, there's no way I can get my boot off. <br>
ODO: Hold on a minute. <br>
(Odo picks up a rock) <br>
ODO: This might hurt a bit. <br>
KIRA: Go ahead. <br>
(Odo hammers at the crystal, and the rock shatters in his hand.) <br>
ODO: I fail to see the humour in this situation. <br>
KIRA: Come on, Odo, it's pretty ridiculous, don't you think? The two of
us being outsmarted by a chunk of crystal. <br>
ODO: I'm not giving up just yet. <br>
KIRA: Neither am I. Hand me my phaser. <br>
ODO: Are you sure this is a good idea? If you're not careful <br>
KIRA: I may blow off my foot and Julian the have a chance to prove what
a wonderful doctor he is? Don't worry, I have no intention of giving
him the opportunity. Stand back. <br>
(The energy makes the crystal grow to her knee.) <br>
KIRA: I guess that wasn't such a good idea after all. <br>
ODO: The crystal formation seems to have somehow fed off the energy
from your phaser. <br>
(moonquake) <br>
ODO: Odo to Mekong. Two to beam out. Energise. Odo to Mekong. I can't
contact the runabout. There's too much interference. I'll have to walk
back to the landing site and try to transport you from there. <br>
KIRA: Are you worried about leaving me here? <br>

QUARK: Is it fixed yet? <br>
ROM: Not yet, brother. <br>
QUARK: What's taking so long? <br>
NOG: We're working as fast as we can. The replicators' entire power

ROM: I told you, brother, if you don't shut down your replicators at
least once a week for routine maintenance, you risk system overloads
like this one. <br>
QUARK: You said it might overload the system. Might. <br>
NOG: He tried to warn you, Uncle Quark. You should've listened to him. <br>
ROM: No. It's my fault. I should have explained it better. <br>
QUARK: Of course it's your fault. Everything that goes wrong here is
your fault. It says so in your contract. Now, this mess had better be

pulled on my Dad this morning. <br>

JAKE: Come on, Nog. You don't really expect me to fall for that one. <br>
NOG: Did you tell your father I was joking? <br>
JAKE: Yeah. Kind of. <br>
NOG: How could you do that to me? I want you to go back to your father
and tell him that you were wrong. <br>
JAKE: All right. Calm down. I mean, how was I supposed to know you were
serious? You never said you wanted to join Starfleet before. <br>

JAKE: So what brought this on? <br>
NOG: I have my reasons. <br>
JAKE: Okay, name one. <br>
NOG: Why should I? <br>
JAKE: Because I'm your friend. And friends don't have secrets from one
another. <br>
NOG: It's not a secret. I just don't feel like talking about it. <br>
JAKE: Why? <br>
NOG: Because it's personal. Now stop asking me. <br>
JAKE: All right. But my father's a pretty smart guy, and if this is
some kind of trick, he's going to figure it out. <br>
NOG: There's nothing to figure out. I'm joining Starfleet, and that's
that. Now, if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to do.

candidates for Starfleet Academy, yours is not the first name that

a lot to be desired. Your school grades are mediocre at best, and

Reports we get from Starfleet Security? <br>
KIRA: Not often. <br>
ODO: You should. They make fascinating reading. A few months ago we got
a report on a theft on Remmil Six. It seems the natives there spin a
kind of crystalline webbing that they use to construct their buildings.
A band of Nausicaan raiders broke into their central museum by using a
high frequency ultrasonic generator to create a sympathetic vibration
inside the webbing and shatter it. <br>

them to give us a hand? <br>

the covariant oscillator on the runabout. The trick will be finding the
right frequency to create a sympathetic vibration inside this crystal.

KIRA: I never pictured O'Brien as a nautical type. <br>
ODO: Next to his work and his family, shooting the rapids is his
favourite activity. He's had the
holoprogram since he was on the Enterprise. <br>
KIRA: How long do these boat trips usually take? <br>
ODO: That depends. <br>
KIRA: On what? <br>
ODO: On how many times we capsize. <br>
KIRA: It must be a very difficult programme. <br>
ODO: It's extremely difficult. According to him, he's dislocated his
shoulder a half dozen times trying to make it down those rapids. <br>
KIRA: Then why does he keep doing it? <br>
ODO: Because he loves it. And it's been my observation that you
humanoids have a hard time giving up the things you love, no matter how
much they might hurt you. <br>
KIRA: I'm glad you're here, Odo. <br>
ODO: I'm glad I'm here, too. <br>
(big moonquake) <br>
KIRA: Odo! <br>
(Rubble starts to fall. Kira tries to shield her head but Odo becomes
an arc and protects her instead. The rock stops falling.) <br>
ODO: Major? <br>
KIRA: I'm all right. What about the generator? <br>
ODO: It's fine. It still hasn't found the right frequency to shatter
the crystal. <br>
KIRA: Tell it to hurry. A couple more tremors like that last one and
this whole cave is going to collapse. <br>
ODO: We'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen. After all, we've
been in worse situations than this one and come out all right. <br>
KIRA: Name three. I can't think of any either. <br>
ODO: No, it's not that. It's just that that wasn't the response I
expected. <br>
KIRA: What do you mean? <br>
ODO: In the detective novels Chief O'Brien gives me to read, when the
hero says, we've been in tougher situations than this one, his friends
always agree. <br>
KIRA: I never read any of those books. <br>
ODO: There must be some humanoid platitude I can use to cheer you up. <br>
KIRA: I don't have much use for platitudes, Odo. I'd rather face the
truth of a situation and go on from there. <br>
ODO: I feel the same way. <br>
KIRA: I know you do. That's why you and I get along so well. <br>
ODO: I suppose it is. But in this case, the truth is we're going to get
you out of here, Major. And that's no platitude.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I must admit, this is impressive work. <br>
DAX: Incredible is more like it. He inventoried the whole cargo bay in
under five hours. <br>
SISKO: You're sure he didn't have any help? <br>
DAX: According to the internal sensors, no one else entered that cargo
bay the entire time he was there. <br>
SISKO: I guess he did learn something working in his uncle's storeroom.
I assume that all our equipment is where it's supposed to be? <br>
DAX: If you're asking if he stole anything, the answer is no. He even
found some things we missed on our last inventory. <br>
SISKO: Okay, so now we know he's a hard worker. The question remains.
Why does he want to join Starfleet? <br>
DAX: I have no idea. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Just Kira's head and fingers are sticking out of
the crystal now. She can barely breath.) <br>
ODO: I don't understand it. I've run through the entire harmonic
spectrum and none of the frequencies have had any effect on the
crystal. It's almost as if the structure of the crystal is mutating to
keep us from finding the right frequency. <br>
KIRA: Odo. <br>
ODO: Yes, Major. I wish there was something else I could do. <br>
KIRA: Just keep talking to me. <br>
ODO: What do you want me to say? <br>
KIRA: Anything. Tell me a story. <br>
ODO: A story? <br>
KIRA: I know. Tell me how you got your name. <br>
ODO: My name? Now that you mention it, that is an amusing story. <br>
KIRA: Tell it to me. <br>
ODO: Well, as you know, when Doctor Mora first brought me to his
laboratory, it was under Cardassian supervision. All specimens had to
be clearly labelled in Cardassian, so the overseers would always know
what the scientists were working on. Since no one was exactly sure what
I was, Mora labelled me Unknown Sample, which the overseer translated
into Cardassian as Odo'ital. <br>
KIRA: So, your name is Unknown Sample? <br>
ODO: No, no. Odo'ital literally means the word 'nothing'. Even after it
became clear that I was sentient, the Bajoran scientists kept calling
me that. As a joke, they split it into two words like a Bajoran name,
Odo Ital, which eventually got shortened. <br>
KIRA: To Odo. <br>
(moonquake) <br>
ODO: But the thing is, for the longest time, whenever anyone would use
my name, the first thing I'd think of was what it meant. Nothing. What
better way to describe me? I had no family, no friends, no place where
I belonged. I thought it was the most appropriate name anyone could
give me. And then I met you. And the others. Sisko, Dax, even Quark.
And now, when I hear one of you call me Odo, I no longer think of
myself as nothing. I think of myself as me. I'm sorry, Major. I guess
that story wasn't as amusing as I'd hoped it would be. <br>
KIRA: No. I liked it very much. The ultrasonic generator isn't going to
work, is it? <br>
ODO: No, I'm afraid it's not. <br>
KIRA: I don't suppose you have any other ideas. <br>
ODO: I wish I had. <br>
KIRA: Neither do I. <br>
ODO: It doesn't make sense. The ultrasonic generator should have
worked. Something's not right here. <br>
KIRA: Odo, you've done your best. It's time for you to go. <br>
ODO: Go? <br>
KIRA: This place is going to collapse at any minute. That Maquis is
probably dead from one of the cave-ins. There's nothing more you can do
for me. <br>
ODO: If you're asking me to leave? <br>
KIRA: As your superior officer, I'm telling you to take the runabout
and get the hell off this moon. That's an order. <br>
(After the break.) <br>
KIRA: Odo, why are you still standing there? I told you to get out of
here. <br>
ODO: I'm not leaving. <br>
KIRA: Constable, I gave you a direct order. <br>
ODO: You can order me all you want. As of now, I'm resigning my
commission. <br>
KIRA: Odo, if you stay here, you'll die. <br>
ODO: You don't know that for certain. And even if it were true, I'm not
going to abandon you. <br>
(moonquake) <br>
KIRA: I want you to get out of here. <br>
ODO: Don't you understand? I can't. <br>
KIRA: You have to. Odo, please. <br>
(moonquake) <br>
ODO: No. I won't leave you. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
ODO: Because! Because I'm in love with you. So, now you know. <br>
KIRA: Odo, I'm in love with you too.

NOG: I appreciate that, Commander. <br>
SISKO: But I'm afraid I'm going to have to turn you down. <br>
NOG: Turn me down? Why? Did I do something wrong? <br>
SISKO: It's not anything you did, Nog. You're just not Academy
material. Here. (the latinum) This belongs to you. <br>
NOG: Commander, can't we talk about this? <br>
SISKO: There's nothing to talk about. We both know you'd never make it
through the Academy. You couldn't handle the workload or the
discipline. You wouldn't last two weeks. <br>
NOG: That's not true. I'm a hard worker. I proved that to you. <br>
SISKO: It doesn't matter. And I'm not going to put my reputation on the
line just to satisfy some whim of yours. <br>
NOG: It's not just a whim. I'm serious about joining Starfleet. <br>
SISKO: I don't have time for this, Nog. Now whatever little scheme you
had, you can forget it. I'm not giving you that letter. <br>
NOG: It's not a joke or a scheme. I want to join Starfleet. I want it
more than anything I've ever wanted anything in my life. <br>
SISKO: You're a Ferengi. Why would you want to be in Starfleet? Where's
the profit in it? <br>
NOG: I don't care about profit. <br>
SISKO: Then what do you care about? Come on, Nog, tell me. Why is it so
damned important for you to get into Starfleet? Why are you doing this?
<br>
NOG: Because I don't want to end up like my father. <br>
SISKO: Your father. <br>
NOG: That's right. My father. He's been chasing profit his whole life,
and what has it gotten him? Nothing. And you know why? Because he
doesn't have the lobes. And neither do I. <br>
SISKO: And a Ferengi without profit <br>
NOG: Is no Ferengi at all. <br>
SISKO: The eighteenth Rule of Acquisition. <br>
NOG: My father is a mechanical genius. He could've been Chief Engineer
of a starship if he'd had the opportunity. But he went into business,
like a good Ferengi. The only thing is, he's not a good Ferengi, not
when it comes to acquiring profit. So now all he has to live for is the
slim chance that someday, somehow, he might be able to take over my
uncle's bar. Well, I'm not going to make the same mistake. I want to do
something with my life. Something worthwhile. <br>
SISKO: Like joining Starfleet. <br>
NOG: I may not have an instinct for business, but I have my father's
hands and my uncle's tenacity. I know I've got something to offer, I
just need the chance to prove it. <br>
SISKO: All right. I'll see that you get that chance. <br>
NOG: You're going to recommend me to Starfleet Academy? <br>
SISKO: I'll send the letter the first thing tomorrow morning. <br>
NOG: Commander, I don't know how to thank you. <br>
SISKO: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't thank me yet. You still have
a lot of work ahead of you. <br>
NOG: Don't worry. You're never going to regret this.

marks on the wall behind her.) <br>
KIRA: Odo? <br>
ODO: Yes, Major. <br>
KIRA: You haven't said a word to me in over an hour. <br>
ODO: I've just been going over a few things in my mind. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry I waited so long to tell you how I feel about you. If
I'd told you earlier, maybe things would've been different. <br>
ODO: Ah. <br>
KIRA: What are you smiling about? <br>
ODO: I think I've finally figured out what's going on here. This whole
situation hasn't seemed right since the beginning. There've been too
many coincidences, too many unanswered questions. <br>
KIRA: Are you still trying to prove that this is all some kind of
conspiracy? <br>
ODO: You said the Maquis was standing here when he shot at you? <br>
KIRA: That's right. <br>
ODO: How tall was he? My height? <br>
KIRA: No. Maybe shorter. <br>
ODO: Like this? <br>
KIRA: More or less. Why does it matter anyway? <br>
ODO: It matters because from this position, you're blocking those
phaser hits. There's no way someone standing here could hit those rocks
without hitting you first. <br>
KIRA: Maybe he was standing somewhere else. <br>
ODO: Maybe. Or maybe you were lying to me. Which makes two times you've
lied to me today. <br>
KIRA: What are you talking about? <br>
ODO: You lied when you said you were shot at by the Maquis. And you
lied when you said you loved me. <br>
KIRA: I do love you. <br>
ODO: I wish you did, but you don't. Remember Major, I pride myself on
my ability to observe human nature, and I've watched you for the past
three years. In all that time I never saw any indication that you had
those kinds of feelings for me. You like me. You think of me as a close
friend. But love? I'm afraid not. <br>
KIRA: Maybe I told I loved you because I thought it would make you feel
better. Because I thought that's what you wanted to hear. <br>
ODO: You're lying again. The Kira I know has far too much regard for
our friendship to lie to me, even for the best of reasons. <br>
KIRA: Odo, I can explain. <br>
ODO: Good. And you can start by telling me who you are and what you've
done with Kira. <br>
(Odo aims the phaser at Kira so she morphs into the female changeling.)
<br>
FOUNDER: Well done, Odo. You really are quite a skilful investigator. <br>
ODO: And you're quite a skilful changeling. <br>
FOUNDER: You still have much to learn. <br>
ODO: If you want to share your wisdom, tell me where Major Kira is. <br>
FOUNDER: Close by. <br>
ODO: You were the fugitive we were chasing, weren't you? <br>
FOUNDER: That's correct. <br>
ODO: How did you get your hands on a Maquis ship? <br>
FOUNDER: Now, Odo, you really can't expect me to give you all the
answers. <br>
ODO: But why did you lead us here? Why replace Kira? <br>
(moonquake) <br>
FOUNDER: I needed to understand why you chose to live with the Solids
rather than your own people. I suspected it had something to do with
Major Kira. Now I'm certain of it. <br>
ODO: So your plan was to let me think she died. You thought that would
take away my link to the Solids. <br>
FOUNDER: Then you would return to us. <br>
ODO: I assure you, nothing will ever make me do that. <br>
FOUNDER: I wouldn't be so sure. <br>
ODO: Tell me where she is. <br>
FOUNDER: And if I don't, then what? You'll shoot me? No changeling has
ever harmed another. <br>
ODO: There's always a first time. <br>
FOUNDER: Major Kira is down that tunnel, two hundred metres south of
here. Save her, if it suits you, but it won't make any difference. She
is never going to love you. How could she? You are a changeling. <br>
