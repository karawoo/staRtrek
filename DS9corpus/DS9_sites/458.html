Sisko and the others. The transporter beam was redirected as it passed
through the polarised particles. <br>
KIRA: Redirected where? <br>
O'BRIEN: Not where, when. <br>
SISKO: You ever hear of the Bell Riots? It was one of the most violent
civil disturbances in American history, and it happened right here. San
Francisco, Sanctuary District A, the first week of September, twenty
twenty four. <br>
BASHIR: That's only a few days from now. <br>
SISKO: The Riots will be one of the watershed events of the twenty
first century. Gabriel Bell will see to that. <br>
DAX: I still haven't found my friends. <br>
CHRIS: And you think they might be in a Sanctuary District? <br>
DAX: It's possible. If you hadn't found me, I might've wound up in one.
<br>
WEBB: This place is about to explode. Most of us agreed to live here
because they promised us jobs. I don't know about you, but I haven't
been on any job interviews lately. <br>
SISKO: That man who just got killed trying to help us? That man was
Gabriel Bell. <br>
(The riot starts.) <br>
SISKO: Give me that. Get back. <br>
(Sisko fires into a brazier. Bashir goes to help Bernardo.) <br>
BASHIR: Get away. Get away from him. <br>
SISKO: Come on. We have to get him off the street. <br>
BC: I've waited a long time for this. And I know I won't be
disappointed. Ain't that right, new boy? <br>
SISKO: The name is Bell. Gabriel Bell. </font></p>

BERNARDO: Nothing. <br>
BC: If you're trying to find a way out, forget it Bernardo. You ain't
going anywhere. None of you are. <br>
LEE: What are you going to do with us? <br>
BC: I was going to let you think about that for a little bit. Now,
everybody, against the wall. Sit down over there. Move! Move it! If any
of them moves, shoot'em. <br>
SISKO: No one's shooting anyone. <br>
BC: Maybe, maybe not. <br>
SISKO: We need them alive. They're the only thing we have to bargain
with. <br>
BC: You think I didn't know that? <br>
SISKO: Just making sure. We need to get these blinds closed. <br>
BASHIR: The police will drop snipers on the roofs across the street,
pick us off one by one. <br>
BC: All right, let's use the benches as barricades. We'll stack them up
against the windows. It's too bad. I kind of like watching this place
burn. <br>
(Vin points his gun at BC.) <br>
VIN: Drop your weapons. What's so funny? <br>
BC: You. You're dead. <br>
(Sisko knocks Vin out of the way as the shot is fired, Lee screams, BC
aims his weapon at her) <br>
BC: Shut up! That's enough! I said shut up! <br>
BASHIR: Leave her alone. She's just scared. Listen, calm down. No one's
going to hurt you. <br>
SISKO: Get over there with the others. <br>
VIN: I know you. I picked you up the other day. <br>
SISKO: I know. It's my way of saying thank you. Now get over there with
the others! <br>
BC: Hey, nice tackle, Bell. You ever play any football? <br>
SISKO: Baseball, actually. <br>
BC: Really, I'd hate to be a catcher and seeing you barreling towards
home plate. Hey, you, get up. <br>
VIN: Leave her alone. <br>
BC: Oh, nice mouth. All right, you get up. I said get up. <br>
SISKO: What are you doing? <br>
BC: Relax. I just want to see what they're saying about us on the Net.
I need his access code to log on. Don't make me ask you again. <br>
VIN: Get lost. <br>
BC: After you. <br>
BERNARDO: Wait. I'll do it. <br>
VIN: What are you doing? Sit down. <br>
BERNARDO: Hey, Vin, we're not on duty now so don't give me orders. I
just want to make it home in one piece. <br>
BC: Smart boy. Move. Get back there. <br>
SISKO: I know what you're thinking. It's not going to be easy keeping
the hostages safe. <br>
BASHIR: It's not just them I'm worried about, it's you. Didn't you say
Gabriel Bell died when the police stormed the building? <br>
SISKO: Right. But I'm not Bell. <br>
BASHIR: No, but we're the only one's who know that. <br>
(They're watching a streamed news report.) <br>
NEWSCASTER [OC]: National Guard units are mobilising now and should
reach Sanctuary District A within the hour.
Governor Chen has issued a statement saying the uprising will be
quelled and District secured. It's still not clear how this riot began,
though rumours of mounting tensions have been filtering out of the
district for weeks. <br>
BC: This is great. We're on every channel. I bet they're even watching
this in China. Why do they sound so surprised? When you treat people
like animals, you're gonna get bit. <br>
WEBB: Let me through. <br>
MAN: Stop right there. <br>
BC: Hey, who said you could come in here? <br>
SISKO: It's okay. Let him in. <br>
BC: You know this gimmie? <br>
SISKO: He's a friend. <br>
BC: Go join your friends. <br>
SISKO: Glad to see you're all right. <br>
WEBB: So much for our peaceful demonstration. <br>
SISKO: I know it's not what we talked about, but it's what happened and
now we have to deal with it. <br>
WEBB: How? It's a madhouse out there and this building is crawling with
ghosts. <br>
SISKO: I know. That's the first thing we have to fix. I want you to go
out and find gimmies, people you know, people who can be trusted to
guard the hostages. <br>
BASHIR: If we leave it to the ghosts, there's no telling what could
happen. <br>
WEBB: I think I know just the people you're looking for. <br>
SISKO: Good. We're going to need them. <br>
BC: Hey, Bell. You're really missing something over here.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEWSCASTER [OC]: Many of the district employees
fleeing the riot have been reported injured and several have yet to be
accounted for. There's been no official count of injuries among
Sanctuary residents, however satellite pictures show a number of
possible casualties. We'll have more on this story as information
becomes available. <br>
CHRIS: This is terrible. <br>
DAX: I've got to get down there. <br>
CHRIS: What are you talking about? <br>
DAX: My friends are in there. <br>
CHRIS: I know they are, but there's nothing you can do for them. <br>
DAX: I have to try. <br>
CHRIS: Jadzia, it is too dangerous. You could get hurt. <br>
DAX: I just can't stay here and watching that place burn, knowing my
friends are inside. <br>
CHRIS: Look, I have friends in the police department. When things
settle down a little bit, I'll talk to them. <br>
DAX: I can't wait that long. By the time things settle down, my friends
could be hurt or even killed. They don't belong in there. None of those
people do. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First officer's log, supplemental. Somehow Sisko,
Dax, and Bashir have altered Earth's history. We have no choice but to
send an away team into the past, to try to find them and to correct the
changes to the timeline. The only problem is, we're not exactly sure
where to look or when.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(O'Brien is recapping the tech solution to Odo for
our benefit.) <br>
O'BRIEN: According to our computer simulations, the degree of temporal
displacement is directly proportional to the number of chroniton
particles interacting with the transporter beam. Unfortunately, there's
no way to know the exact concentration of particles at the time of the
accident, but I've narrowed it down to ten possibilities, each one
corresponding with a different time frame. One of them has to be right.
We just hope we find the right one before we run out of chroniton
particles. <br>
(Kira enters with a plaster over her nose and no earring) <br>
KIRA: I feel ridiculous. <br>
ODO: Well, it does effectively disguise your Bajoran heritage. <br>
O'BRIEN: Just say you broke your nose. On the other hand, maybe you'd
better say nothing. I'll do the talking. <br>
KIRA: That's fine with me. <br>
ODO: Good luck. <br>
KIRA: Energise. </font></p>

others materialized, there should be a residual electrostatic charge. <br>
KIRA: Kira to Sisko. Kira to Dax. Kira to Bashir. <br>
(There's a car parked nearby) <br>
O'BRIEN: Judging from this vehicle, I'd say we were somewhere in the
mid-twentieth century. <br>
KIRA: No one's responding to my hails. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not reading any electrostatic variance or any distress
signals. They're definitely not here. <br>
KIRA: How long before the transporter re-engages? <br>
O'BRIEN: About thirty seconds. <br>
(A couple come out of a Speakeasy) <br>
O'BRIEN: Evening. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BC: I've got one question for you two. What are all
these gimmies doing here? <br>
WEBB: I asked them to help. <br>
BC: And who invited you? <br>
SISKO: I did. <br>
BC: Look, last time I checked this was my party. That means I get to
decide who's on the guest list and who isn't. <br>
SISKO: We needed people we could trust in here. <br>
BC: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
SISKO: How many ghosts do you know who you can really trust? <br>
BC: One. Me. And that's enough. <br>
SISKO: No, it isn't. Not here. Not now. <br>
WEBB: We need people to guard the building, watch the exits, keep an
eye on the hostages when we need to sleep. <br>
BC: All right, all right, you made your point. Just keep them out of my
hair. <br>
SISKO: The important thing we have to decide is what we're going to do
with those hostages. <br>
BC: Don't have to worry about that. I've got it all figured out. <br>
WEBB: I bet you do. <br>
BC: And just to prove I'm not such a bad guy, I'm going to let you two
in on it. It's simple. We trade the hostages for our freedom. We get
amnesty, a handful of credit chips, and a flight to anywhere we want.
Personally, I'm thinking Tasmania. <br>
SISKO: Tasmania. <br>
BC: Errol Flynn was born in Tasmania. Look, you guys go where you want
and I'll go where I want, all right? <br>
WEBB: Yeah, and as soon as we step off the plane, they lock us up. <br>
SISKO: Besides, we can't just think about ourselves. There are ten
thousand people living in here. <br>
BC: Well let them get their own hostages. <br>
WEBB: No, Gabe is right. This is an opportunity for us to be heard. To
let people on the outside know exactly what's going on in here. <br>
SISKO: You want to make demands, I'll give you some demands. We tell
them if they want the hostages back, they've got to shut down the
Sanctuaries. <br>
WEBB: And reinstate the Federal Employment Act. <br>
BC: Why don't you have them throw in a couple of silk shirts, maybe a
penthouse in Singapore. Jobs? You guys want jobs? When are you going to
get it? There are no jobs. Not for us, anyway. <br>
SISKO: They'll find jobs. They'll have to. After tonight, they won't be
able to ignore us anymore. <br>
BC: All right. All right, we'll do it your way. I'll log onto the
Interface and I'll tell them that we want the District closed. <br>
SISKO: Not you. Him. <br>
WEBB: Funny, I would have nominated you. <br>
BC: What? Is there something wrong with me? I can be as eloquent as the
next guy. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure you can. But they can't dismiss Webb as easily as you
or me. He's got the face. He's got the family. He's the guy next door.
And that's what they need to see.

WEBB: My name is Michael Webb. I used to be a Plant Manager at ChemTech
Industries. I'm speaking for the residents of Sanctuary District A.
We're holding six hostages. We don't want to hurt them. All we want is <br>
BASHIR: What happened? <br>
SISKO: Someone cut off our access to the Interface. <br>
BC: I knew it! I knew this was a waste of time. They don't care. No one
cares about us. <br>
VIN: Why should they? You're all a bunch of losers. <br>
BC: What did you say? <br>
BERNARDO: He didn't say anything. <br>
VIN: You heard me. I called you a loser because that's what you are.
And this time, you're going to lose big. <br>
SISKO: That's enough! <br>
VIN: Check your e-mail, buddy. You're a loser, too. <br>
BASHIR: If you want to get out of here, you'd better hope you're wrong.
<br>
BERNARDO: Quiet down, Vin. You'll only make things worse. <br>
VIN: I just want these guys to know what they're in for. I bet the
National Guard's already has this place surrounded. Sooner or later
they'll come rolling right in here, and you people aren't even going to
slow them down. <br>
BC: I really think we should kill this guy. <br>
(A woman's voice comes from the terminal.) <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: Mister Webb, I'm Detective Preston from the SFPD.
It's urgent that I speak with you. <br>
WEBB: Did you shut off our access to the Interface? <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: I'm afraid it's department policy in these types
of situations, but it does give us a chance to talk one-on-one <br>
WEBB: All right, let's talk. <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: First, I want to see the hostages. <br>
WEBB: What for? <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: I need to make sure they're okay. You said you
weren't going to hurt them. I need to know I can count on that. <br>
BC: Get up. Let's go. They want to see a hostage, let's show them a
hostage. <br>
(It's Lee.) <br>
BC: Take a good look, lady. I've got five more just like her. And if we
don't get what we want, they're going to get hurt. <br>
SISKO: I think you've made your point. <br>
BC: Have I, Detective? <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: I'd say so. <br>
BC: Good. <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with
Mister Webb again. <br>
BC: Why would I mind? <br>
WEBB: All right, Detective, I'm here. <br>
PRESTON [on monitor]: Your friend has quite a temper. <br>
WEBB: That's because he's angry. We all are. <br>
(meanwhile, walking away) <br>
SISKO: BC, let me ask you something. <br>
BC: Go ahead. <br>
SISKO: Why do I get the feeling that you're not going to be happy until
you've hurt one of those hostages? <br>
BC: I have to admit, the thought has crossed my mind. It might
alleviate some of the stress I'm feeling. <br>
SISKO: I think you'd better find a way to deal with that stress. It's
sure to be a lot healthier for you in the long run. <br>
BC: No kidding. Let me ask you something. You think it looks better
like this or like this? <br>
(BC turns down the brim of his hat.) <br>
SISKO: It's your head. and your decision. <br>
WEBB: Hey, Gabe .Detective Preston wants to meet with me. <br>
SISKO: When? <br>
WEBB: Now, by the main gate. <br>
SISKO: May I join you? <br>
WEBB: I was hoping you'd say that. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRESTON: It's been a long night for all of us. You
guys must be exhausted. <br>
WEBB: We're okay. We could use some breakfast come morning. <br>
PRESTON: Breakfast for ten thousand? That's a lot of take-out. But in
the interest of friendship, I'll do what I can. Now, how about
returning the favour and letting me have one of the hostages? <br>
WEBB: No hostage, no food. Is that what you're saying? <br>
PRESTON: Not at all. You'll get the food either way. Giving up one of
the hostages would show good faith. Besides, you'd still have five
left. <br>
SISKO: Those hostages aren't going anywhere until we get what we want. <br>
PRESTON: Which is what? <br>
SISKO: We want the Sanctuaries closed and the Federal Employment Act
reinstated. <br>
PRESTON: That's asking a lot. <br>
SISKO: I don't think so. What we want is to get out from behind these
walls, to stop having to depend on handouts. <br>
WEBB: That's right. All we're asking for is a chance to get back on our
feet again. We don't deserve to be locked up in here. <br>

and he didn't want you to put his real name on the computer. <br>
LEE: When I first started working here, I processed a woman who had a
warrant out on her for abandoning her kid. She couldn't take care of
him, so she left him with a family that she worked for over in the
Marina. I felt so sorry for her I didn't log her in. I just let her
disappear into the Sanctuary. <br>

LEE: Almost got me fired when my supervisor found out. <br>

later, the government is going to retake the Sanctuary District. And
when they do, a lot of people are going to die. And unless the public
