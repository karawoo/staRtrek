O'BRIEN: How's it going, Jake? <br>
JAKE: Fine. I've deleted half the Cardassian files from the computer. I
can't believe how many subroutines it took just to run this ore
processor. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, it used to be a pretty large operation. When the
Cardassians were in charge, I understand they processed twenty thousand
tons a day. <br>
JAKE: That's a lot of ore. <br>
O'BRIEN: It must've been hell in here. I heard stories that the
temperature reached fifty five degrees Celsius. <br>
JAKE: How could the Bajoran workers survive that? <br>
O'BRIEN: A lot of them didn't. When you've deleted all those files,
I'll show you how to download the new operating system. <br>
JAKE: You really think we can convert this place into a deuterium
refinery? <br>
O'BRIEN: Absolutely. It'll take us three, maybe four weeks at the most.
<br>
SISKO: I hope you're planning on eating during the next three to four
weeks. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander. I guess I lost track of the time. <br>
JAKE: We're almost finished, Dad. Chief, I'm having a problem deleting
one of these files. <br>
O'BRIEN: Have you tried reformatting the data cluster? <br>
JAKE: Yeah, but the file's still here <br>
O'BRIEN: Let me see. That's odd. <br>
SISKO: What's that, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, the file has no name. No indication what it is. I'd
better set it aside for now. I can transfer it to the central database
in Ops and analyse it in the morning. <br>

DAX: What? <br>
BASHIR: If this security programme thinks there's been some kind of
worker revolt, then it must think this station is still under
Cardassian rule, so it's probably waiting for us to enter an emergency
code. <br>
KIRA: One that the Cardassians never bothered to give us when they
left. <br>

I'm attempting to override the security programme but it's going to
take some time. I'm not sure my clearance level is high enough. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Well, keep at it. We'll try to do the same thing from up
here. <br>
ODO: Acknowledged. <br>
(Quark enters) <br>
QUARK: Odo, do you mind telling me what this is all about? That message
from Dukat is making my customers nervous, and when they're nervous
they're not <br>
ODO: Not now, Quark. I'm busy. <br>
QUARK: Well, is there anything I can do to help? <br>
ODO: Not unless you have a level nine Cardassian security clearance. <br>
QUARK: Let's see. I think I have everything from levels one through
seven. <br>
ODO: I only have levels one through six. <br>
QUARK: Well, if you'd like a level seven, I'm sure we could make some
kind of arrangement. <br>
ODO: Leave me alone, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Oh, no. There's something very wrong going on and this is the
safest place on the whole station. I think I'll stay right here. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko is trying an access door to the chute on the
upper level.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Any luck? <br>
SISKO: Nothing. It's probably magnetically sealed like the door. We'd
need a phaser to blast it open. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, there's no way I can disable the programme from here. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Bajoran workers, your time is running out. But it's
not too late. You can still surrender and save your lives. <br>
SISKO: Computer. This is the leader of the Bajoran workers. We
surrender. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I'm glad to see you've come to your senses. Stay
where you are. When Cardassian security arrives, they will place you
into custody but you will not be harmed. You have my word. <br>
O'BRIEN: Whatever that's worth. <br>
JAKE: Now what? <br>
SISKO: Well, it sounds like the programme is going to wait for
Cardassian security to enter the all-clear protocol. That'll give us a
few minutes, anyway. What's in here? <br>
(He thumps on the chute) <br>
O'BRIEN: Nothing at the moment. Processed uridium used to flow down
that pipe to a secondary refining facility on level thirty three and be
purified. <br>
(Jake pulls a panel off the bottom of the chute.) <br>
JAKE: It's not locked. <br>
SISKO: Since that pipe was filled with molten uridium, there wasn't any
need for security measures. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's too narrow for anyone to escape through. <br>
JAKE: I can get in there. <br>
SISKO: Chief, if he can crawl up this pipe into the machine, cab he can
get to the ore chute and open that hatch from inside? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Bajoran workers, you have not surrendered to
Cardassian security. If you do not do so in the next three minutes, I
will be forced to release neurocine gas into the ore processing
facility. <br>
JAKE: I can do it. <br>
(Jake gets into the bottom of the chute.) <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Bajoran workers, you have two minutes left to give
yourselves up to your Cardassian overseers and save your lives. <br>
SISKO: Can you hear me, Jake? <br>
JAKE [OC]: Loud and clear, but I can't see a thing. <br>
O'BRIEN: There should be a large circular opening to your right. <br>
JAKE [OC]: Okay, let me see if I can find it. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Even if you were to escape this station <br>
(Bang) <br>
JAKE [OC]: Ow! <br>
SISKO: Jake-o, are you all right? <br>
JAKE [OC]: Yeah, I just banged my head on something. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Back to Bajor? I can tell you <br>
JAKE [OC]: Wait a second, there's a junction here. It feels like it
goes off in two directions. Which way do I go? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: The guls in charge. <br>
SISKO: Follow this sound, Jake. <br>
(Sisko taps the pipe with a metal bar) <br>
JAKE [OC]: Do it again, Dad. Got it. I'm in the chute. <br>
(The Dukat recording drones on under the dialogue) <br>
O'BRIEN: There should be a small access port in one of the walls. <br>
JAKE [OC]: Found it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Open the port and feel around inside for a handle. It should
be shaped like a stirrup. <br>
SISKO: You know, I never knew how much this man's voice annoyed me. <br>
JAKE [OC]: I can reach, but I can't get hold of it. <br>
O'BRIEN: You have to pull the handle down, Jake. It's the release for
the hatch. <br>
JAKE [OC]: I'm trying, I can't <br>
SISKO: Don't tense up, relax. Now just take a deep breath and try
again. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I'm sorry, but your time has run out. I was hoping
you would be reasonable. Rest assured that your deaths will serve as an
example to prevent similar incidents in the future. <br>
(The gas starts to come in.) <br>
JAKE [OC]: I got it. <br>
(Jake opens the door on the upper level and the two men up scramble
then into the chute)

JAKE: I don't know. Some kind of room. It sure is dirty. Doesn't smell
too good either. <br>
SISKO: Looks like some kind of loading bay. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're right. This is where the uridium ore was separated from
the rock. Then it would be dumped down that chute to the processing
facility. <br>
(Sisko tries the door.) <br>
SISKO: Locked. Chief, is there another way out of here? <br>

the rest of the station. <br>
BASHIR: There must be some kind of general dampening field in place. It
must be disrupting communications. <br>
KIRA: All right. It's time for a less subtle approach. <br>
(She adjusts her phaser and aims it at the door control Bashir is
working on.) <br>
KIRA: Doctor. <br>
(The manual lever is freed and the door opens, but there's a forcefield
beyond.) <br>
BASHIR: The Cardassians don't miss a trick, do they? <br>
DAX: The ironic thing is that field is probably there to protect Ops
from the hoards of rebelling Bajorans. <br>
KIRA: Well we've got to find a way of disabling the security programme
or a lot of people are going to be killed. <br>
DAX: If we can regain control of the main computer, we may be able to
wipe the security programme from its memory. Now, if I can reroute the
APT relay through the secondary buffer, I might get an independent
terminal working. <br>
BASHIR: You know, I've been here nearly three years and I was just
finally starting to think of this place as home. <br>
KIRA: Your home was built by Cardassians, Doctor. Don't ever forget
that. <br>

office.) <br>
QUARK: But you're a shape-shifter. Excuse me, a changeling. So change

O'BRIEN: Not even a dent. <br>
SISKO: There has to be something else we can do. What about all this
ore? As I understand it, uridium's very unstable. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's true, but in it's raw form you'd need a strong
electrical charge to detonate it. <br>
SISKO: Can we use that? <br>
(A lighting panel.) <br>

out some electrical cable. <br>

DAX: I was reaching toward the ODN conduit and a small forcefield went
off and it caught my hands. <br>
(Kira hands down the kit.) <br>
BASHIR: They're second degree burns but I don't think there's any
neural damage. This should relieve the pain. <br>
COMPUTER: Warning, security in the Operations Centre has been
compromised. Initiating counterinsurgency programme level two. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Attention, Bajoran workers. Your failure to
surrender is forcing me to take stronger measures. In five minutes, we
will begin pumping neurocine gas into the habitat ring. Think of your
families as you consider your course of action. All Cardassian
personnel should evacuate the area immediately. <br>
KIRA: Habitat ring. There have to be hundreds of people trapped in
their quarters out there. <br>
GARAK: I believe that's the point, Major. Computer, access code Garak
one three five nine. <br>
(The door forcefield drops, Garak steps through the door, then
forcefield returns.) <br>
GARAK: Ironic isn't it? The only place in the galaxy that still
recognises my access code is a Bajoran space station. <br>
KIRA: If you can get past the forcefields, you've got to get out to the
habitat ring and start evacuating those people before <br>
GARAK: I'd like nothing better than to help my loyal customers, but
it's not that simple. My access code enables me to move about the
station, but unfortunately, as you've just seen, the forcefields
reappear the moment I pass through a doorway. <br>
BASHIR: Have you tried using your code to shut down the security
programme? <br>
GARAK: Several times, but for some reason I can't begin to fathom, Gul
Dukat chose not to trust me with his top level security codes during
the occupation. <br>
BASHIR: Garak, do you know a way we can stop this neurocine gas? <br>
GARAK: The only way to do that is to destroy the life support system. <br>
KIRA: What are you trying to do, Garak? Get us all killed? <br>
BASHIR: No, wait a minute. He's right. The neurocine gas is released
through the life support system. Destroy it and we save everyone in the
habitat ring. <br>
DAX: For twelve hours. And then everyone on the station will suffocate
when we run out of oxygen. <br>
BASHIR: Well, that gives us twelve hours to regain control of this
station. <br>
GARAK: Believe me, Major, it's the only way to save those people. I
believe life support is controlled from over there. <br>

flicker.) <br>

KIRA: Any luck? <br>
GARAK: Plenty, Major. Unfortunately, all of it bad. My personal code
can activate any terminal on the station. However, that's the extent of
my access. All I can do is just look around. I can tell you exactly
what's going on, but I can't do anything about it. As far as I can see,
the only person who can disable the security programme is Gul Dukat. <br>
DAX: Maybe there's a way to fool the computer into thinking that you
are Gul Dukat. You could try rewriting your code to match his. <br>
GARAK: Even if I could, it wouldn't do any good. If I were to input his
code, the computer would scan my DNA pattern to determine if I really
were Dukat. <br>
DAX: But what if we disabled the sensors in Ops so that the computer
couldn't scan you? <br>
GARAK: What a creative idea. It certainly is worth a try. <br>
BASHIR: The question is, can we disconnect the sensors without getting
anyone else hurt. <br>
KIRA: We're just going to have to take that chance. <br>
DAX: We could switch the sensor input from the primary scanners to the
backup scanners. The computer shouldn't see that as a threat, but it'll
blind the system for a few seconds while we make the changeover. <br>

GARAK: I wouldn't even venture a guess. Which reminds me, those pants
you wanted altered are ready to be picked up. Oh, this is a problem. <br>
BASHIR: What's wrong? <br>
GARAK: I always suspected that Dukat was a little paranoid. He's left a
rather large number of interrogative subroutines imbedded in his access

I say I am. Lieutenant, how much long before you can disable those

trouble. Where's Commander Sisko? I trust he wasn't vaporised while
asking for one of those raktajinos he's so fond of. <br>
DAX: No. Last we heard, he was trapped in the ore processing unit. <br>
DUKAT: Hmm. I wish him well. <br>
BASHIR: Well, can you help us or not? <br>
DUKAT: Oh, most certainly. All I have to do is enter my command code
and shut the programme. <br>
KIRA: Then do it! <br>
DUKAT: All in good time, Major Kira. All in good time. But first, there
are a few things we should discuss. Red leaf tea, please. <br>
(The weapon turns into a mug, and Bashir puts his head above a
console.) <br>
DUKAT: Doctor. <br>
(The weapon returns, and fires at Bashir.) <br>
KIRA: What do you want, Dukat? <br>
DUKAT: You'll find I don't react well to that tone of voice, Major.
Garak, grovelling in a corner. That alone makes my trip worthwhile. <br>
(Garak stands up.) <br>
BASHIR: Garak! <br>
GARAK: Easy, Doctor. It would appear that the computer is only
targeting non-Cardassians. <br>
DUKAT: If you had been on the station when I designed this programme, I
would have made an exception in your case. <br>
GARAK: Well, you've always been shortsighted. It's held you back over
the years. As I recall, your father had the same flaw. <br>
DUKAT: My father's only flaw was trusting you. <br>
GARAK: Funny, at his trial your father said his biggest flaw was that
his ambition outweighed his patriotism. <br>
KIRA: Maybe you two could settle this at another time! <br>
DUKAT: You're right, Major. Oh, believe me, Garak, that time is coming.
Major, why don't you join me in the Commander's office where we can
talk in private. Oh. I forgot. The replicator. Well, it's the least I
can do. <br>
(Dukat taps a command into the replicator and the weapon disappears.) <br>
DUKAT: You can all rise now. You're safe, for the moment. Major.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Commander's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dukat settles into Sisko's chair.) <br>
DUKAT: I know time is of the essence, Major, so I'll be brief. (he
sends the baseball rolling across the floor.) I think it is time to
re-establish a permanent Cardassian presence aboard this station.
Nothing too elaborate, mind you. A garrison would suffice. I can deploy
troops from my ship immediately. And in return, I'll solve your current
dilemma. <br>
KIRA: You know I'm never going to agree to that. <br>
DUKAT: I'm not sure you have much of a choice, do you? <br>
KIRA: Dukat, you and I both know neither Bajor nor the Federation will
ever honour an agreement negotiated under a death threat. <br>
DUKAT: I don't expect them to be happy about it, but once my troops are
in place I think you'll find it very difficult to get them to leave. <br>
KIRA: Well let me put this another way. I will destroy this station
before I ever give it back to the Cardassians. <br>
DUKAT: Yes, I'm sure you would. But would you allow two thousand people
aboard this station to die simply because you don't like us? Well,
there's no need to decide just yet. We still have a little time left.
Thirty minutes, in fact. Why don't I return to my ship so that you'll
have time to think about it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT: I'll be back in say, twenty five minutes.
Dukat. One to transport. Energise. (nothing) Energise. <br>
KELL [on monitor]: Dukat, if you are seeing this recording, it means
you tried to abandon your post while the station's self-destruct
sequence was engaged. That will not be permitted. <br>
DUKAT: This is outrageous. <br>
KELL [on monitor]: You have lost control of Terok Nor, disgracing
yourself and Cardassia. Your attempt to escape is no doubt a final act
of cowardice. All fail-safes have been eliminated. Your personal access
codes have been rescinded. The destruct sequence can no longer be
halted. All you can do now is contemplate the depth of your disgrace
and try to die like a Cardassian. <br>
(After the commercials) <br>
DUKAT: Computer, abort the self-destruct sequence. This is a priority
one override. Clearance level nine. Authorisation Dukat five one one
six green. <br>
COMPUTER: Request denied. All authorisation codes are void. Time to
self-destruct, twenty-five minutes. <br>
GARAK: Even your own computer programme turns against you. I always
knew your shortsightedness would be your downfall. <br>
DUKAT: I don't see you coming up with any ideas, tailor. <br>
KIRA: Look, if you two are finished with the insults, we could use some
help here. Now, what can you tell us about the self-destruct sequence? <br>
DUKAT: It's very simple. When the countdown is completed, the computer
will order the main fusion reactor to disengage the reaction
stabilisers, causing it to overload, destroying the station. <br>
DAX: What about the reactor? Is there any way to shut it down? <br>
DUKAT: It may be possible to manually disengage the laser fusion
initiator, but in order to do that we have to be in the reactor room. <br>
DAX: Not necessarily. We can disengage the initiator from one of the
control junctions on level thirty four. <br>
BASHIR: But now that the computer's wiped out the access codes, not
even a Cardassian can get out of this room. <br>
KIRA: Well then, maybe we should concentrate on trying to eliminate the
forcefield protecting the door. <br>
DAX: We don't have time to eliminate every forcefield between here and
level thirty four. What we need to do is find a way to deactivate all
the forcefields on the station at the same time.

more we run the risk of bringing the whole room down around our ears. <br>
(O'Brien pulls a bright power cable out of the panel.) <br>
SISKO: All right, we'd better take cover. <br>
O'BRIEN: Would you like to do the honours, sir? <br>

Major, I will find a way to defeat it. There's no dilemma that cannot
be solved by a disciplined, Cardassian mind. <br>
GARAK: It's not going to work, you know. <br>
DUKAT: What are you babbling about now? <br>
GARAK: I'm talking about Major Kira <br>
KIRA: What about her? <br>
GARAK: She's much too busy trying to save this station to be impressed
with your incessant posturing. <br>
DUKAT: Garak! <br>
GARAK: And even if she weren't, she has much better taste than to be
attracted to you. And you, a married man <br>
DUKAT: I should've had you executed years ago. <br>
GARAK: You tried, remember? <br>
BASHIR: Garak, this isn't helping. <br>
DAX: Wait a minute. What about the power supply grid? If we could
overload the grid, we might be able to cause a power surge and short
out all the forcefields on the station. <br>
KIRA: It might even be enough to eliminate the dampening field that's
been keeping us from using our communicators. <br>
DUKAT: Tell me something, Major. The Cardassian neutralisation emitters
that were under here. I assume you deactivated them when you control of
the station? <br>
KIRA: That's right. We prefer our containment fields to be non-lethal. <br>
DUKAT: But are the emitters still in place? <br>
KIRA: As far as I know. <br>
DUKAT: Excellent. That means they have not been affected by the
counterinsurgency programme. That means we still have control of them. <br>
DAX: Then if we can get the emitters back online, we can use them to
overload the power grid. <br>
DUKAT: Exactly. <br>
KIRA: Do you think it'll be enough to eliminate the forcefields? <br>
DAX: Unfortunately, we'll lose the turbolifts and the transporters, but
they aren't much use to us right now anyway. <br>
KIRA: Let's give it a try.
