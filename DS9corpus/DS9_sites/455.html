in this afternoon. I've got to have more cargo space. <br>
KIRA: All right. Have them offload into cargo bays three and four, but
that's it. We are pushing our storage capacity as it is. <br>
O'BRIEN: That reminds me. We got a message last night saying the
Byzallians want to move their conference up by a week. <br>
KIRA: I haven't had a chance to read through last night's reports. Is
there anything else I should know? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, er. <br>

Campor Three next week. If I don't have get those medical supplies, the
entire colonisation schedule could be set back by at least <br>

medical supplies, and I don't give a damn about the colonisation
schedule. Those colonists can make do with a box of bandages for all I
care. <br>
BASHIR: Stop right there, Major. When was your last day off? <br>
KIRA: I don't know. What does that have to do with anything? <br>

RIKER: Thank you. Call me Will. <br>
SISKO: What brings you to Deep Space Nine? <br>
RIKER: Strictly pleasure. Actually, I've built up about three months of
leave and Doctor Crusher finally insisted that I take some of it. She
nearly shoved me out the airlock. <br>
SISKO: DS Nine isn't exactly known as a vacation spa. <br>
RIKER: Actually I was just passing through on my way to Risa. The last
time I was here, I was only able to spend a couple of hours at Quark's,
but by the time I left I had all of his latinum and a date with one of
his dabo girls, so I thought I might try my luck again. <br>
SISKO: You be careful. Quark's dabo wheel has been a little stingy
recently. And one of his dabo girls is dating my son. <br>
RIKER: In that case, maybe I better spend my time in the holosuites. It
sounds safer, all the way around. </font></p>

DAX: And then? <br>
KIRA: And then we talked. For three hours. No, we just talked. And yes,
he's a warm, charming man, but I'm involved with someone. <br>
DAX: Of course. So why do you keep glancing back at Sisko's office? <br>

SISKO: If you can find the time, you have an open invitation for dinner
with me and Jake. <br>
RIKER: Thank you, I may take you up on that. <br>
DAX: I hope you're not here for another loan. Don't tell me you've
forgotten who staked you three strips of latinum when your winning
streak ran dry? <br>

you been, Dax? <br>

RIKER: My mind was a million light years away. I should've been paying
attention to where I was going. <br>
KIRA: Are you doing some shopping? <br>
RIKER: Actually I was just exploring the Promenade. I thought about
going into Quark's, but I wasn't really in the mood. Where are you off
to? <br>
KIRA: I'm just getting off duty. I was about to call it a night. <br>
RIKER: I see. Well, goodnight. <br>
KIRA: Goodnight. <br>
(Kira walks on then turns back.) <br>
KIRA: Commander, would you like a tour of the station? <br>
RIKER: I'd love one. Where should we begin? <br>
KIRA: We can walk along the Promenade for a start. There's quite a bit
to see here. <br>
RIKER: Do you think we might get a chance to take a look at that new
starship of yours? What's she called? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Nine years ago, a transporter accident created
two William T. Rikers. One of them returned to his ship, the other was
marooned on Nervala Four. <br>
SISKO: <a href="../NextGen/250.htm"> The second Riker was
finally discovered two years
ago</a>. He chose to use his middle name Thomas to distinguish
himself from the other Riker. <br>
ODO: The two men are physically identical in all respects, right down
to their DNA coding. There was no way for the security computer to know
that it was Thomas, not William, who boarded the Defiant. <br>
DUKAT: This is a very entertaining story, but why am I listening to it?
<br>
SISKO: We have reason to believe that Thomas Riker is a member of the
Maquis. <br>
DUKAT: What? <br>
ODO: Thomas Riker was serving aboard the starship Gandhi. While he was
there, he began to express certain political opinions. Opinions that
supported the Maquis and their goals. <br>
DUKAT: Are you telling me that one of the most heavily armed warships
in this quadrant is now in the hands of Maquis terrorists? Do you have
any idea what kind of response this will provoke from the Central
Command? <br>
SISKO: They'll probably want to send ships into the Demilitarised zone
to conduct a search. We understand that. But any entry into the zone
must be a joint operation between Cardassia and the Federation. <br>
DUKAT: The Central Command will not be interested in any joint
operation, Commander. They won't believe your story about transporter
duplicates and security failures. They will assume that Starfleet
wanted the Maquis to have the Defiant, and they will respond
accordingly. <br>
ODO: And what does that mean, exactly? <br>
DUKAT: It means they will seize this opportunity to finally eliminate
the Maquis. They'll send a fleet into that zone. <br>
SISKO: Starfleet will cooperate in a search for the Defiant, but they
will not allow the Central Command to use this as an excuse for a
full-scale invasion. <br>
DUKAT: Of course not. So you will send your own fleet into the zone to
protect Federation colonies. But at some point the two fleets will
meet, tensions will rise, nerves will fray, and someone will make the
tiniest mistake. <br>
SISKO: And we'll have a war on our hands. <br>
DUKAT: It is a prospect I do not relish, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Neither do we. <br>
ODO: That's why we need to work together to prevent it from happening. <br>
DUKAT: Unless I can bring something back to Central Command to prove
your good faith and your willingness to help stop the Defiant, I don't
believe anything can prevent this conflict from beginning. <br>
SISKO: Then bring me with you. I can help you stop the Defiant and
prove our good faith. I was in charge of the shipyard where the Defiant
was built. I helped design it. I know her vulnerabilities and her
weaknesses. <br>
DUKAT: You'll help us destroy one of your own ships? <br>
SISKO: I want to try and disable it first. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, I'm sure you do, but you're in no position to bargain here,
Commander. You want to prevent a war? You come back to Cardassia with
me and you help me destroy the Defiant. </font></p>

KORINAS: Excuse me. (to soldier) Secure that console while the human is

Dukat's decision to bring you here, we must take some precautions. <br>
SISKO: Of course. I would have done the same. But then I would have
been more discreet. <br>
KORINAS: Since you are here to provide technical expertise on the
Defiant, I suggest you begin by briefing us on the ship's defensive
capabilities. Please, describe for us in detail the weapon systems of
the Defiant, beginning with the ship's phaser array and <br>
SISKO: Before we discuss weaponry, there is a more urgent matter that I
think you should be aware of. The Defiant is equipped with a cloaking
device. <br>
KORINAS: I wondered if you were going to share that little detail with
us. <br>
DUKAT: You knew about this? <br>
KORINAS: The Obsidian Order has known for some time about the loan of a
cloaking device from the Romulans to the Federation. <br>
DUKAT: And the Order chose not to share this intelligence with the
Central Command? <br>
KORINAS: Until now, the Order had not considered this one cloak to be a
threat against Cardassia. <br>
SISKO: Under the terms of our agreement with the Romulans, the cloaking
device was to be used only in the Gamma Quadrant and then only in
exchange for all our intelligence reports on the Dominion. <br>
DUKAT: Well, your Lieutenant Riker isn't likely to respect that
agreement with the Romulans. And there's no way to locate a ship under
cloak. <br>
SISKO: There is one possibility. The Dominion managed to penetrate the
cloak by using some kind of anti-proton beam. <br>
DUKAT: Can you give us the specifications of that beam? <br>
SISKO: Not precisely, but I can give you everything we've learned from
our sensor logs. It'll give you a chance to find the Defiant before she

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Fifteen outposts have checked in. No sign of
the Defiant. Twenty-six warships have scanned fourteen cubic light
years of space with anti-proton beams. No Defiant. What are the
possibilities? They're still under cloak and heading deeper into
Cardassian space. They're laying low and waiting for some unknown
reason. Dukat, are you listening to me? <br>
DUKAT: Oh, I'm sorry, Commander. I was thinking about my son's
birthday. <br>
SISKO: Really? <br>
DUKAT: Yes. Today is his eleventh birthday. I'd promised to take him to
the amusement centre in Lakarian City. He always wanted to go but I
never have the time. I told him, this year will be different this year,
Mekor. This year I will make the time. <br>
SISKO: I've had the same experience with Jake. At that age they never
understand, do they. You just hope that one day they'll look back and
say, now I understand, now I know why he did that. <br>
DUKAT: When my son looks back on this day, the only thing he'll
remember is that a Federation officer on a Federation ship invaded his
home and kept his father away from him on his eleventh birthday. And he
won't look back with understanding, he'll look back with hatred. And
that's sad.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Defiant goes back under cloak.) <br>
TAMAL: The cloak is operating within normal parameters but the plasma
conduit damage has caused a slight neutrino leak in the port nacelle.
The Cardassians might be able to detect it even through the cloak. <br>
RIKER: A chance we have to take. Lay in a course for Omekla Three.
Engage at warp eight. <br>
KALITA: Warp eight, aye sir. <br>
KIRA: Omekla Three? You're headed for the shipyard? There have to be
half a dozen better targets in this sector alone. <br>
RIKER: I hope the Cardassians have the same reaction. What is he doing,
and why? <br>
KIRA: All right, you're trying to keep them off-balance, keep them
guessing. Why? <br>
RIKER: The Maquis have been hearing rumours about shifting loyalties in
the Cardassian government. Certain hardline elements were unsatisfied
with the Federation Treaty and are doing whatever they can to scrap it.
We had our hands on an intelligence report outlining a suspected
military buildup in the Orias System. A secret buildup that even the
Central Command isn't aware of. <br>
KIRA: You're telling me you did all of this to attack some secret base
that may or may not exist? <br>
RIKER: I'm convinced that it does. They are building an invasion fleet.
If we let them finish it, these renegade Cardassians are going to use
it. <br>
KIRA: You're really not cut out for this, are you? Being a terrorist, I
mean. You're not very good at it. <br>
RIKER: Really? <br>
KIRA: You're acting more like a Starfleet officer who's more interested
in intelligence reports and Cardassian politics than in actually
hurting Cardassians. You have one of the most powerful ships in this
quadrant under your command. Why aren't you out attacking every
Cardassian outpost along the border? <br>
RIKER: Because these stakes here are far greater than border outposts. <br>
KIRA: Not for the Maquis, there're not, because the Maquis are
terrorists and the only thing terrorists care about is attacking the
enemy. I know. I was a terrorist. And if I'd had this ship then, I
would've destroyed Deep Space Nine. I would've hit the Cardassians so
hard they would have screamed for peace, but I certainly wouldn't have
gone flying off into the middle of Cardassia on some wild goose chase. <br>
RIKER: I guess we're different kinds of terrorists. <br>
KIRA: No, you're trying to be a hero. Terrorists don't get to be
heroes. <br>
RIKER: We'll see.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[War room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: This is how your ships were deployed before
the first Defiant attack. And this is where they are now. Don't you see
what happened? Each Defiant attack was designed to draw your ships away
from that sector, leaving it virtually defenseless. <br>
DUKAT: But there's nothing of any value in that sector. <br>
SISKO: There must be something. Are there any Class-M planets there? <br>
DUKAT: There's one. Orias Three. But it's uninhabited, it's desolate. <br>
SISKO: But everything seems to point to the Orias System. It might be
worth your sending one of your warships there just in case the Defiant
does show up. <br>
DUKAT: All right. Contact Gul Ranor. Tell him to dispatch one warship <br>
KORINAS: No. You'll send no ships to the Orias system. <br>
DUKAT: You're here as an observer. You have no authority <br>
KORINAS: That sector is under direct control of the Obsidian Order and
you will not enter it. <br>
DUKAT: Why? <br>
KORINAS: That matter's classified. <br>
DUKAT: Well you can file a complaint with the Central Command later.
Open a channel to Gul Ranor now. <br>
KORINAS: Any warship sent into the Orias system will be destroyed. <br>
DUKAT: Are you saying that you will fire on another Cardassian ship? <br>
KORINAS: What I am saying is that the Obsidian Order will take whatever
steps are necessary to protect the Orias system. And so will I. <br>
(A short time later, Dukat returns to the room.) <br>
DUKAT: I've spoken to a few friends in the Central Command. The
Obsidian Order isn't giving them any answers either. <br>
SISKO: The Order has to answer to someone. <br>
DUKAT: In theory they answer to the political authority of the Detapa
Council, just as the military does. In practice we both run our own
affairs. <br>
SISKO: Not the most efficient system. <br>
DUKAT: It's worked for over five centuries. <br>
SOLDIER: There's an incoming message from the warship Kraxon. They say
they've found an unusual neutrino signature in their sector. It looks
like radiation from a damaged warp plasma relay. <br>
DUKAT: Is this signature moving? <br>
SOLDIER: No. But they're scanning the area with their anti-proton
beams. <br>
DUKAT: Where is the Kraxon? <br>
(The location is brought up on the viewscreen) <br>
SISKO: If it is the Defiant, they're in position to make a run for the
Orias system. <br>
DUKAT: We still don't know that Orias is the target. Until we do, I
can't risk pulling ships away from other potential targets to chase
down a neutrino signature.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KALITA: They're coming around for another pass. <br>
RIKER: Are there any other ships nearby? <br>
KALITA: There are nine Galor-class cruisers about six light years away.
<br>
RIKER: Any ships between us and the Orias system? <br>
KALITA: No. <br>
KIRA: If you make a run for it, that ship out there's going to see our
neutrino signature go through a phase change. They're going to call
their nine friends and you are going to have a small fleet chasing you
all the way to Orias. <br>
RIKER: They can chase me all they want, as long as they don't catch me.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[War room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOLDIER: The Kraxon reports that the neutrino
signature has just phase-shifted, and is moving now at warp speed
directly toward the Orias system. <br>
DUKAT: Order the Kraxon to pursue at maximum warp. Order all other
ships in the sector to follow.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KALITA: The Kraxon is pursuing but they won't catch
us before we reach Orias. <br>
RIKER: Full scan. I want to see everything that's in that system.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[War room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT: When you make out your report for the
Obsidian Order be sure to mention the fact that I could have prevented
the Defiant from reaching Orias if you hadn't interfered. <br>
KORINAS: They will never reach Orias. You can count on that. <br>
SOLDIER: Three more ships have just appeared in the Orias system. <br>
DUKAT: What kind of ships? <br>
SOLDIER: Cardassian warships. Keldon Class. <br>
DUKAT: Whose ships are those, Korinas? <br>
KORINAS: Why are you asking me? <br>
DUKAT: Because if they were military ships, I would know about them. So
that leaves the Obsidian Order. <br>
SISKO: I thought the Obsidian Order didn't have any ships. <br>
DUKAT: They're not supposed to. In fact, they are explicitly forbidden
from having military equipment of any kind. <br>
(Korinas smiles and walks out.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: It looks like we're going to have to fight
our way to Orias. <br>
KIRA: Listen to me. Those three ships up ahead are going to lock onto
our neutrino leak and open fire. That means you'll have to fight back. <br>
RIKER: With this ship it'll be a short fight, I promise you that. <br>
KIRA: Let's say you disable or even destroy those three ships up ahead
of us. Fighting them at all is going to slow us down and then those ten
ships behind us are going to catch up, and not even the Defiant can win
against those odds. <br>
RIKER: We have come too far to quit now. <br>
KIRA: You are an experienced Starfleet officer, Tom. Analyse the
situation, Tom. Going to Orias is suicide. Now the smart move is to
make a run for it while we still can. <br>
RIKER: Maybe that's what an experienced Starfleet officer would do.
Maybe that's what Will Riker would do. But it's not what I'm going to
do. I'm going to continue the mission. <br>
KIRA: It's not the mission you're thinking about, is it, or even the
colonists in the zone. This is about you, isn't it? You and that other
Will Riker out there. The man with your face, your name, your career.
You are looking for a way to set yourself apart. Some way to be
different. <br>
RIKER: You shouldn't go fishing today. You won't catch anything. Take
us in.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[War room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: You want to know what's going on in the
Orias system? I know how you can find out. Give Riker a chance to
surrender. The Defiant's scanned the Orias system by now. Its sensor
logs can tell you everything you want to know. <br>
DUKAT: I'd be happy to accept his surrender but I doubt he'll be
willing to hand over his logs. <br>
SISKO: He will if you agree to release Major Kira, the ship and the
Maquis over to the Federation. <br>
GUL DUKAT: Impossible. I cannot allow a group of terrorists to just
walk away after invading our territory and <br>
SISKO: Then you must decide which is important to you. Your sense of
Cardassian justice or the information contained in the Defiant's sensor
logs. <br>
DUKAT: I do want that information, Commander, and I would be willing to
return your wayward ship. But someone has to pay for what's happened
here and I don't want that someone to be me. <br>
SISKO: If you return the Maquis to the Federation, I can promise that
you they will stand trial for what they've done. <br>
DUKAT: A Federation trial <br>
SISKO: It's the best I can do. <br>
DUKAT: All right. I would be willing to hand over Major Kira, the
Maquis, and the ship, but not Riker. He led the mission. If I can bring
him to justice and obtain the information on Orias, that might be
enough for Central Command. <br>
SISKO: I might be able to get him to do it on one condition. We both
know that Cardassian sentences are determined well in advance of the
trial. I'd like you to arrange a sentence other than death. <br>
DUKAT: I'll have to clear that with the Ministry of Justice. <br>
SISKO: You'd better make it quick.

be in phaser range in fifteen seconds. <br>
RIKER: Go to impulse. Decloak the ship, Raise shields and stand by
phasers. Go to heading one one eight, mark three zero one. Lock on
phasers. Fire. <br>
KALITA: Direct hit on the cruiser's port nacelle. Their shields are

DUKAT [on viewscreen]: This is Gul Dukat of the Second Order. I am
authorised to tell you that if you surrender your ship none of you will
be harmed. <br>
RIKER: Is that right <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: Listen to him, Lieutenant. If you surrender, the
Defiant and your crew will be handed over to a Federation starship at
the Cardassian border. <br>
RIKER: Why the sudden generosity? <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: He wants the Defiant's sensor logs on the Orias
system. They're worth a lot more to him than Maquis prisoners. <br>
RIKER: I don't buy it. The Cardassians aren't going to just let us just
walk away. <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: You're right. Someone has to pay the price. <br>
RIKER: Me. <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: The deal is you'll be tried and convicted in a
Cardassian court and then sentenced to spend the rest of your life in
the Lazon Two labour camp. <br>
RIKER: No death sentence, huh? That must have taken some doing. <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: Some. <br>
RIKER: Give me a moment. <br>
KIRA: Tom, there's no reason for you to continue. They're offering you
a way out. The only reason not to take it is because you want to die. <br>
RIKER: I have a mission to complete. <br>
KIRA: That mission is over. You're never going to make it to Orias, you
know that Tom. There are five ships out there ahead of you but there
may be fifty waiting there for all we know. Be a Starfleet officer one
last time. Think of your crew. I know you want Tom Riker to go out in a
blaze of glory that they'll talk about for the next ten years. Don't
drag them along with you. <br>
RIKER: On screen. I agree to your terms. <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: You need to reverse course and surrender the
Defiant to one of the ships that've been following you. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
SISKO [on viewscreen]: It'll take too long to explain. But the ships
coming out of the Orias system are not under Gul Dukat's control. <br>
RIKER: I see. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I've ordered the Kraxon to put her shields
around you as soon as you arrive. You'll be safe once you get there. <br>
