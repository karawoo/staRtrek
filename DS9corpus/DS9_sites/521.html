NOG: Squid. My favourite human food. Mmm. Delicious, sir. <br>
JAKE: Terrific as always, Dad. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad you like it. <br>
NOG: Sir, if I may say so, this sauce tastes very familiar. <br>
SISKO: Well it should. It's puree of tube grubs. <br>
(Jake vomits into his napkin.) <br>
JAKE: Tube grubs? <br>
SISKO: I figured if Nog is willing to eat squid, it's only fair that we
try tube grubs. Besides, you said it was terrific. <br>
JAKE: That was before I knew what it was. <br>
SISKO: Eat. You need more meat on your bones. So, tell me, Nog. How do
you like working security? <br>
NOG: It's very interesting, sir. <br>
JAKE: That's not what you told me. <br>
NOG: Jake. <br>
SISKO: Something wrong? <br>
NOG: No, sir. Everything's quite satisfactory. Thank you, sir. <br>
JAKE: Could've fooled me. <br>
SISKO: Cadet, if there's a problem, I want to hear about it. <br>
NOG: Well, sir, it's the Klingons, sir. <br>
SISKO: What about them? <br>
NOG: It's their attitude, sir. It's bad. <br>
SISKO: Bad? <br>
NOG: They're loud, obnoxious, and if I may say so, sir, generally
intoxicated. They walk around the station like they own the place, and
whenever a station security officer tries to talk to them, say to ask
them to keep the noise level down on the Promenade, they ignore him. <br>
JAKE: You mean they ignore you. <br>
NOG: They never look me in the eye when I try to talk to them, sir.
They just stare over my head and pretend I'm not even there. I hate it
when they do that. <br>
SISKO: I can see how that might be annoying. <br>
JAKE: Not as annoying as listening to him complain about it all the
time. <br>
SISKO: Here is what I suggest, Cadet. The next time the Klingons refuse
to acknowledge your presence, do what a Klingon would do. Confront them
about it. If you stand up to them, you'll earn their respect. <br>
JAKE: Or get your butt kicked. One or the other. <br>
SISKO: Either way, they'll never ignore you again. <br>
(Doorbell) <br>
SISKO: Enter. <br>
MARTOK: Captain, I need to speak to you. Alone. <br>
NOG: That does it. <br>
SISKO: Not now, Nog. <br>
NOG: But sir. <br>
JAKE: Come on, Nog, let's go. <br>
(Jake drags Nog out.) <br>
MARTOK: Captain, my crew and I were patrolling the Cardassian border.
We intercepted a very disturbing message. <br>
(Martok hands over a PADD.) <br>
SISKO: This is a Maquis code. <br>
MARTOK: I was as surprised as you. I thought the Maquis were wiped out
by Cardassia and their new Dominion allies, but it would appear I was
mistaken. <br>
SISKO: Were you able to decode it? <br>
REBECCA [on PADD]: Michael, I hope you get this message. We've launched
the missiles. They should reach Cardassia in thirteen days. It may not
bring back our dead, but at least they'll have a lot of company. <br>
SISKO: Did you detect any missiles? <br>
MARTOK: No. But that proves nothing. A few months ago, the Klingon High
Council decided to aid the Maquis in their fight against Cardassia. We
provided them with thirty class four cloaking devices. It was our
understanding they would use them on their ships. <br>
SISKO: But they could have been mounted on the missiles instead. <br>
MARTOK: You see the problem. <br>
SISKO: The Maquis had access to tricobalt explosives, biogenic weapons,
antimatter warheads. <br>
MARTOK: The death toll could be in the millions. <br>
SISKO: I knew the Maquis were desperate, but I didn't believe that they
would resort to something like this. <br>
MARTOK: A sabre bear is most deadly when it is trapped with no hope of
escape. <br>
SISKO: Cardassia is under Dominion protection. If millions of their
citizens are killed by human terrorists, they'll demand revenge. <br>
MARTOK: And their Dominion allies will see that they get it. They'll
launch a counterstrike against the Federation, the Klingon Empire, and
the entire Alpha Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: And start a war that could destroy us all.

SISKO: Report. <br>
DAX: Do the words needle in a haystack mean anything to you? <br>
WORF: We spent over fifty hours searching the Badlands for signs of the
Maquis missiles, without success. <br>
DAX: We would have stayed longer, but we had a hard time avoiding the
Jem'Hadar patrols. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let me guess. They homed in on your plasma wake. <br>
DAX: Even though we were cloaked, they were still able to track us. <br>
O'BRIEN: The Defiant's warp engines are too powerful. They ionise the
nebular gases in the Badlands. <br>
DAX: It's like a Ligorian mastodon moving through the forest. You may
not be able to see it, but it definitely makes the leaves rustle. <br>
SISKO: I need answers, people. If those missiles do exist, they're only
eleven days from their target. I want to know where they are and how to
stop them. <br>
WORF: We need more information, a way to narrow our search. <br>
SISKO: I think I know someone who can help.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Eddington, wake up. <br>
EDDINGTON: I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. <br>
SISKO: This is a nightmare, all right, but you are wide awake. <br>
EDDINGTON: I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you
here weeks ago. <br>
SISKO: I've been busy. <br>
EDDINGTON: But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I
know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. <br>
SISKO: I'm not here to gloat. <br>
EDDINGTON: You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the
Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your
revenge. <br>
SISKO: Actually, that's what I'm here to talk to you about. Revenge. <br>
EDDINGTON: One of my favourite topics. <br>
(The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) <br>
SISKO: I believe that was intended for you. <br>
REBECCA [on PADD]: Michael, I hope you get this message. We've launched
the missiles. They should reach Carda <br>
SISKO: Don't you want to hear the rest of it? <br>
EDDINGTON: Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a
very common name. <br>
SISKO: True. But somehow I think you're the right one. <br>
EDDINGTON: Guess again. <br>
SISKO: If those missiles hit Cardassia, it could start a war. Billions
of people will be killed. <br>
EDDINGTON: If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be
disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the
Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the
reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I
cared about was wiped out. <br>
SISKO: I heard the same reports. It was a tragedy. <br>
EDDINGTON: Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a
damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what
happens to you. <br>
SISKO: You may have taken off the uniform, but you're still a Starfleet
officer. And you don't want a war between the Federation and the
Dominion any more than I do. <br>
EDDINGTON: What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's
nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets.
They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at
random. You'll never find them. <br>
SISKO: Maybe we can't locate the missiles, but that doesn't mean we
can't stop them. You must have programmed in an abort code, some way to
deactivate the missiles by remote. <br>
EDDINGTON: Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it
from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that
either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck,
Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. <br>
SISKO: That's it? You're just going to lie there and do nothing. <br>
EDDINGTON: That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit
back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological
evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. <br>
SISKO: What if I could get you out of here? Arrange a pardon in
exchange for your helping me? <br>
EDDINGTON: You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of
others. It makes you feel important. <br>
SISKO: It's not about me. Do you want your freedom or not? <br>
EDDINGTON: Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I
go? What would I do? <br>
SISKO: Anything you want. <br>
EDDINGTON: What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do
that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll
tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this
place to pieces and me along with it.

QUARK: Careful, that hurts. <br>
BASHIR: I haven't done anything yet. <br>
QUARK: Well, what are you waiting for? I told you it hurts. <br>
(Odo and Kira enter.) <br>
ODO: You'll survive. <br>
QUARK: Did you catch him? <br>
ODO: We caught him. Or rather I should say Major Kira caught him. <br>
KIRA: I didn't really do anything. I was in the Bajoran shrine,
meditating, and he burst in stark naked, and fell to his knees crying
out to the Prophets for protection. <br>
BASHIR: Morn, of all people. Who would have thought he'd just snap like
that? <br>
ODO: Certainly not me. Which makes me wonder what could've pushed him
over the edge? <br>
QUARK: Why are you looking at me? I'm the victim here. He hit me with a
barstool. <br>
KIRA: Why did he hit you? <br>
QUARK: I don't have the faintest idea. <br>
KIRA: Think harder. <br>
ODO: Witnesses say you were talking to him right up to the second he
went berserk. <br>
QUARK: Of course I was talking to him. That's what bartenders are
supposed to do, talk to their customers. <br>
KIRA: What exactly was it that you were talking to him about? <br>
QUARK: All I said was that the military personnel on this station were
starting to look a little nervous. When they get nervous, I get
nervous. <br>
ODO: And that's all you said? <br>
QUARK: Basically. I might've done a little harmless theorising. <br>
BASHIR: About what? <br>
QUARK: Oh, something like it was only a matter of time before the
Dominion launched a full-scale assault against the Federation and when
that happened the station would undoubtedly be their first target. And
I might've idly suggested that there wasn't a chance in hell that any
of us would get out of here alive. <br>
ODO: And that's when Morn hit you with a barstool and ran out onto the
Promenade screaming, 'We're all doomed.' <br>
QUARK: Some people just don't react well to stress. Ow! <br>
DAX [OC]: Ops to Major Kira. <br>
KIRA: Go ahead. <br>
DAX [OC]: There's an incoming transmission from Captain Sisko. <br>
KIRA: I'll be right there. Probably wants to warn us that the first
wave of Jem'Hadar is on the way. <br>
(Kira leaves) <br>
QUARK: Ha, ha, ha. Very funny. She's joking, right? <br>
BASHIR: Hold still.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Dinner. <br>
EDDINGTON: What about these? <br>
SISKO: What about them? <br>
EDDINGTON: It makes it a little difficult to eat. <br>
SISKO: You'll manage. <br>
EDDINGTON: Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and
rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us
to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating.
Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. <br>
SISKO: It's not that bad. <br>
EDDINGTON: It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like
replicated protein molecules to me. <br>
SISKO: If you don't want it, don't eat it. <br>
EDDINGTON: Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior
staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those
vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real.
Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. <br>
SISKO: I wasn't aware that you were a food critic. <br>
EDDINGTON: I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real
food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a
baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow
tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot,
it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably
burned to the ground along with everything else. <br>
SISKO: If we don't stop those missiles, a lot of things are going to
burn to the ground. And not just on Cardassia. <br>
EDDINGTON: You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a
pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the
mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As
far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. <br>
SISKO: For a dead man, you talk a lot. <br>
EDDINGTON: Then why didn't you leave me in prison? <br>
SISKO: Because I have a job to do and I can't do it without you. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out
of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean
it now. <br>
SISKO: I am trying to prevent a war. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after
me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the
other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it.
You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the
end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than
that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't
heard that name in a while. <br>
SISKO: You're right about that. <br>
EDDINGTON: He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. <br>
SISKO: And a long time after. <br>
EDDINGTON: Until he joined the Maquis. <br>
SISKO: He betrayed his oath to Starfleet. <br>
EDDINGTON: If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He
was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. <br>
SISKO: He was a good man. <br>
EDDINGTON: He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about
the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never
forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed
Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what
this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must
follow. <br>
SISKO: Is that what you really believe? <br>
EDDINGTON: It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a
threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain
on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy
measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. <br>
SISKO: You want to blame me for what happened to the Maquis? Fine. Go
ahead, blame me. Blame Starfleet. Blame the Federation. Blame everyone
except Michael Eddington. <br>
EDDINGTON: The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. <br>
SISKO: Your leadership. Your shining moment of glory. Michael Eddington
gets to take off his gold uniform and play hero. That's what you always
wanted, to lead troops in a glorious cause. Well, you had your chance
and look where you led them. Right into their graves. <br>
EDDINGTON: They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most.
Because you put me in jail. <br>
SISKO: They died because you filled their heads with false hopes. Sold
them dreams of a military victory when what they needed was a
negotiated peace. <br>
EDDINGTON: We had the Cardassians on the run. <br>
SISKO: And they ran right into the arms of the Dominion. End of story. <br>
EDDINGTON: Not quite the end. <br>
SISKO: That's right. A few survivors of your noble crusade have decided
to launch a pointless retaliatory strike against Cardassia. <br>
EDDINGTON: It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes
you just have to settle for revenge. <br>
SISKO: Is that what you want? To be remembered as the man who helped
bring about the worst war in Federation history? <br>
EDDINGTON: Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. <br>

SISKO: A bird? <br>
EDDINGTON: A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian
coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. <br>
SISKO: It's probably in some locker in the Assay Office, along with the
rest of your things. <br>
EDDINGTON: I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. <br>
SISKO: Speaking of things you thought you'd lost. <br>
(Jem'Hadar.) <br>
EDDINGTON: There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. <br>
SISKO: Obviously there is. Can we lose them again? <br>
EDDINGTON: Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. <br>
SISKO: Don't tell me the Maquis didn't have plan B. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're not going to like it. <br>
SISKO: Half an AU and closing. If you do have a plan, I guarantee I'll
learn to love it. <br>
EDDINGTON: We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. <br>
SISKO: You mean shut down the engines? They'd be on us in a second. <br>
EDDINGTON: Who said anything about shutting down the engines? <br>
SISKO: You're thinking about realigning the emitter while the engines
are engaged? One wrong move and the flow regulators will blow up in
your face. <br>
EDDINGTON: You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you
finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field
behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave
should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing.
You'd better get started. <br>

by the shockwave.) <br>
EDDINGTON: Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the

Captain Sisko. <br>
COMPUTER: Internal sensors are offline. <br>
EDDINGTON: Of course they are. <br>

forehead.) <br>
SISKO: I told you to keep the ship steady. <br>
EDDINGTON: You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure. Now, get us to the launch site!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAKE: I understand, but all I'm saying, Nog, is
next time you know I have a girl over, just call me before you come
home. <br>
NOG: The two of you were only talking. <br>
JAKE: Well, you never know. <br>
NOG: Jake, I know your track record. You never get past talking. <br>
JAKE: Now that's a scurrilous lie. <br>
NOG: Scurrilous? Is that worse than a regular lie? <br>
JAKE: Look, I don't know what the big deal is. Just check before you
come home, okay? <br>
NOG: Okay. And you do the same. <br>
JAKE: Nog, you haven't had a date since you left the Academy. Unless
you're counting holosuites. <br>
NOG: Now who's being scurrilous? <br>
(Martok and some Klingons are in Nog and Jake's favourite place on the
upper level.) <br>
NOG: I don't believe this. <br>
JAKE: What's wrong? <br>
NOG: They're loitering on the Promenade in our old spot. <br>
JAKE: I guess they know a good view when they see one. <br>
NOG: Jake, don't you get it? They know I'm territorial about that spot.
They're purposely doing this to insult me. <br>

Jake. This could get ugly. <br>
(Nog walks up behind Martok.) <br>
NOG: All right, it's time for you to move along. <br>
MARTOK: We will decide when it is time to move. <br>
NOG: Station regulation eight two slash seven B clearly states that
loitering on the Promenade is prohibited. <br>
MARTOK: Is that so? <br>
NOG: It is. Now either move or I'm going to have to place you under
arrest. <br>
(Martok bends down to look Nog right in the eye) <br>
MARTOK: You are either very brave or very stupid, Ferengi. <br>
NOG: Probably a little of both. <br>
MARTOK: (smiles) Indeed. Courage comes in all sizes. But don't tempt
fate. Khi-gosH. <br>
(The Klingons leave.) <br>
JAKE: Nog, I'm impressed. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They arrive at a planet.) <br>
EDDINGTON: Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock
in the middle of nowhere. <br>
SISKO: What better place to hide a missile launching site? <br>
EDDINGTON: We thought so. <br>
SISKO: The sensors aren't detecting anything. <br>
EDDINGTON: That's the general idea. There's too much interference to
detect anything, but it's there. <br>
SISKO: We'll never get a transporter through all this static. <br>
EDDINGTON: We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the
launch site. <br>
SISKO: Then take us down.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tunnel]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Underground, of course.) <br>
SISKO: How far? <br>
EDDINGTON: A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. <br>
SISKO: These tunnels are man-made. <br>
EDDINGTON: I know. I helped dig them myself.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Maquis settlement]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv,
and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) <br>
SISKO: Now where? <br>
EDDINGTON: Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. <br>
SISKO: You hear something? <br>
(Jem'Hadar soldiers walk past in the fog. A gunfight starts. Eddington
and Sisko dive for cover behind convenient barrels and crates.) <br>
SISKO: These barrels are made of duridium. That should hold them off
for a while. I thought you said the Jem'Hadar would never find this
place. <br>
EDDINGTON: I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them.
In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as
hitting us. <br>
SISKO: Too risky. <br>
EDDINGTON: You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of
attitude. <br>
SISKO: It's not me that I'm worried about, it's you. If you get killed,
there'll be no way to stop those missiles. <br>
(Sisko gives Eddington the phaser.) <br>
SISKO: Take this. I'll go around and try to draw their fire. You should
be able to catch them off guard when they come after me. <br>
EDDINGTON: I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know
what I'm aiming at? <br>
SISKO: I'll be the one holding the pipe. <br>
EDDINGTON: Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a
brilliant plan. <br>
SISKO: It could be worse. <br>
EDDINGTON: I know. It could be me holding the pipe. <br>
SISKO: Exactly. <br>
(The shooting stops. Tapping sounds divert the Jem'Hadar one way then
Sisko hits one around the head from the other side and wrestles the
second for his rifle. Eddington shoots the first one and watches until
Sisko is on the floor. Then he shoots the second Jem'Hadar.) <br>
SISKO: You've got sharp eyes. <br>
EDDINGTON: Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked
down first, and then I shot the one still standing. <br>
SISKO: Thank you for your vote of confidence. <br>
EDDINGTON: Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that
way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. <br>
(They chuck the bodies down the well.) <br>
SISKO: In a couple of minutes this entire settlement is going to be
crawling with Jem'Hadar. I suggest you get us to the launch site now. <br>
EDDINGTON: That way. <br>
SISKO: Are you sure? <br>
EDDINGTON: Reasonably. <br>
(They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps
on the sides of the buildings.) <br>
EDDINGTON: We're close. <br>
SISKO: Then let's keep moving. <br>
(They advance a few steps.) <br>
SISKO: Wait. <br>
(There's a body on the ground.) <br>
EDDINGTON: Vance. <br>
SISKO: You knew him? <br>
EDDINGTON: He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. <br>
SISKO: There are more. <br>
(There are corpses lying across barrels and crates, and all down the
next alley.) <br>
EDDINGTON: This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The
Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were
going to declare themselves an independent nation. <br>
SISKO: Eddington, listen to me. This is not the time. <br>
EDDINGTON: It's over. <br>
SISKO: It's not over. We still have to stop those missiles. <br>
EDDINGTON: That's all you care about? The missiles? <br>
SISKO: It's too late for us to help these people. But if we don't stop
the missiles, this'll just be the beginning. <br>
EDDINGTON: I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed.
I failed them all. <br>
SISKO: Maybe we all failed them. Maybe we could've prevented this from
happening. I don't know. It's going to take a long time and a lot of
soul-searching before I find the answer, but right now we have a
mission to complete. <br>
(Eddington points the rifle at Sisko.) <br>
EDDINGTON: I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me
feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time.

clear. <br>
SISKO: Wait. <br>
(Sisko opens fire with the Jem'Hadar rifle. Two shrouded Jem'Hadar
appear and fall.) <br>
EDDINGTON: I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. <br>
(At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) <br>
EDDINGTON: No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let
me try something. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There is a group of people inside.) <br>
REBECCA: Michael, I wondered when you'd get here. <br>
EDDINGTON: I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to
meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here.
We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access
the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each
other in the fog. <br>
(Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) <br>
SISKO: Wait a minute. What about disarming the missiles? <br>
EDDINGTON: Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? <br>
SISKO: Eddington, I want the truth. Now. <br>
REBECCA: There never were any missiles, no retaliatory strike against
Cardassia. It was all a ploy, a way to let Michael know that we'd made
it here. <br>
EDDINGTON: This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to
evacuate these people. <br>
SISKO: What would you have done if I hadn't forced you to come with me?
<br>
EDDINGTON: I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That
Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to
happen. <br>
SISKO: Yes, you're right. That is good news. But I still don't like
being lied to. <br>
(And he hits Eddington. Hard.) <br>
EDDINGTON: I hope you're ready to finish what you started. <br>
REBECCA: Michael, we don't have time for this. <br>
EDDINGTON: We'll finish this later. <br>
REBECCA: All right, you heard what Michael said. Stick together.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: You should've told me the truth. If I had
known the Jem'Hadar were going to be here, I would have brought more
men. <br>
EDDINGTON: The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about
this base but us. <br>
REBECCA: They landed three days ago. We tried to fight. <br>
EDDINGTON: I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there <br>
REBECCA: I didn't think I'd make it either, but they kept all the
leaders alive. They were going to make a present of us to the
Cardassian government. Now I guess we'll end up in a Federation prison.
<br>
EDDINGTON: No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say
about it. <br>
SISKO: Right now, I suggest you concentrate on getting off this planet.
We can worry about the rest later. <br>
EDDINGTON: There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us
in prison. Not this time. <br>
SISKO: Damn it, you never give up, do you, Mister Eddington? <br>
EDDINGTON: Never. <br>
(One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) <br>
SISKO: Move! <br>

handy barrels.) <br>
EDDINGTON: Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the
runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. <br>
REBECCA: I'm staying with you. <br>
EDDINGTON: I'll be right behind you. Now get going. <br>

Jem'Hadar.) <br>
SISKO: I didn't know you were married. <br>
EDDINGTON: We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. <br>
SISKO: Not much of a honeymoon. I suggest we fall back now. <br>
EDDINGTON: For once, you'll get no argument from me. <br>
(Eddington is shot.) <br>

EDDINGTON: You'd better get to the runabout. <br>

romantic than a glorious death in defence of a lost cause. <br>
SISKO: He died fighting for what he believed in. I called him a traitor
once, but in a way he was the most loyal man I ever met. He was a
