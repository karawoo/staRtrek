<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROSS: Starfleet has chosen you to plan the
invasion of Cardassia. <br>
(The destruction of the defences at Chin'toka.) <br>
(Dukat freeing the pah-wraith and becoming possessed.) <br>
(Pah wraith Dukat attacking Jadzia Dax.) <br>
BASHIR: I managed to save the Dax symbiont. There was nothing I could
do for Jadzia. <br>
(Worf warning the afterlife that a Klingon warrior's soul is coming.) <br>
(The Pah wraith leaving Dukat and the wormhole collapsing in on
itself.) <br>
WEYOUN: Federation soldiers have landed on Cardassian soil and now
you're telling me the wormhole is gone and with it any chance of
getting reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: Why aren't you still here, Jadzia? I need you to help me sort
things out. Something's happened to the Prophets, something that's made
them turn their backs on Bajor and I'm responsible. And I don't know
what to do about it, how to make it right again. I've failed as the
Emissary, and for the first time in my life I've failed in my duty as a
Starfleet officer. <br>
SISKO: The station's all yours, Major. <br>
KIRA: She'll be here when you get back. <br>
SISKO: Let's go home, Jake. </font></p>

ODO: Colonel. <br>
KIRA: I wish you'd stop doing that. <br>
ODO: Doing what? <br>
KIRA: Calling me by my rank. I was promoted two months ago. Besides, it
sounds so formal. <br>
ODO: Well, has Admiral Ross, or should I say Bill, arrived yet? <br>
KIRA: The admiral's ship is due in three hours, and I wish I knew what
he wanted to talk to me about. <br>
ODO: Maybe he's bringing good news. We could certainly use it. <br>
KIRA: Yeah, well don't get your hopes up. There was something about the
tone of his voice. <br>
ODO: Something ominous? <br>
KIRA: Something pleasant. It was like he was going out of his way to be
nice. <br>
ODO: I see. <br>
KIRA: Well, whatever he wants to tell me, he knows I'm not going to
like it. <br>
ODO: How can you be so sure? <br>
KIRA: It comes with the job. No, I'm serious. Sitting in the Captain's
chair, having that kind of responsibility, it focuses you. <br>
ODO: Well, I'll take your word for it. <br>
KIRA: How long have they been there? <br>
ODO: Three days. <br>
KIRA: I remember when the cult of the Pah wraiths was a joke. Now those
red armbands are appearing all over Bajor. It's like everyone's gone
crazy. <br>
ODO: A lot of people feel abandoned by the Prophets. <br>
KIRA: Believe me, I know how they feel. That's no excuse to turn to
hate and fear. <br>
ODO: In times of trouble, some people find comfort in hate and fear. If
you'd like, I can charge them with loitering and have them removed from
the station. <br>
KIRA: Oh, what good would that do? I keep thinking if the Emissary were
here, things might be different. <br>
ODO: I would have thought we would have heard from Captain Sisko by
now. <br>
KIRA: Not a word in three months. <br>
ODO: Nerys. I realise that things may seem bleak at the moment, but
there's always hope. <br>
KIRA: When did you turn into an optimist? <br>
ODO: Must have been that day in front of Quark's, when we kissed for
the first time. <br>
KIRA: That was some kiss, wasn't it? <br>
ODO: Changed my life.

O'BRIEN: Gentlemen, we are home. <br>
BASHIR: There should be a law against convoy duty lasting more than ten
days. <br>
NOG: I'll say one thing for guarding convoys, it's usually a lot safer
than being on the front lines. <br>
WORF: Is that the reason you joined Starfleet, Ensign? To be safe? <br>
NOG: I didn't mean that the way it sounded, sir. <br>
WORF: In wartime, it is the duty of every soldier fight. <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. <br>
WORF: The invasion of Cardassia has ground to a halt while our
casualties continue to mount. It is a time for warriors to do great
deeds, to triumph in glorious battle, not waste away protecting a
shipment of stembolts. <br>
(Worf leaves.) <br>
NOG: I hope Commander Worf doesn't think I'm afraid to fight. <br>
O'BRIEN: Relax, don't take it so personally. Worf is just going through
a bad time at the moment. <br>
BASHIR: I think he needs to focus on something other than Jadzia, and I
hate to admit it but a little combat duty just might do the trick. <br>
O'BRIEN: Pretty soon the Defiant will be going into battle, Worf will
be happy and the rest of us will be miserable. <br>
NOG: It's not that I'm afraid to fight, I just don't want to die. I
wish Captain Sisko were here. <br>
O'BRIEN: So do I, Ensign. So do I.

Joseph is maitre d' and Jake is waiting on table.) <br>
JOSEPH: If I were you, I'd order the crawfish etoufee. And if it's good
enough for you, it's good enough for him. I think table five is ready
to order. <br>
JAKE: He's been at that piano since seven o'clock this morning. <br>
JOSEPH: Customers seem to like it. <br>
JAKE: Grandpa. <br>
JOSEPH: Look, I'm worried too, but he's got something to work out. Best
we leave him alone. <br>
JAKE: We've left him alone for three months. He said he came here to
figure out a way to contact the Prophets, to make things right. So far
he hasn't even left the restaurant. <br>
(Sisko's baseball rolls off the piano and leans over to get it he goes
into a vision of himself digging in a desert to uncover the carved face
of a woman. The stone turns into dark skin and her eyes open. End of
vision.) <br>
JAKE: Dad? What's wrong? Dad? <br>
SISKO: I had a vision from the Prophets. I was on Tyree, in the desert,
digging in the sand, and I uncovered a face. The face of a woman. <br>
JAKE: And? <br>
SISKO: And that's all. <br>
JAKE: Who was she? <br>
SISKO: I've never seen her before, but now I know why I came back here,
Jake. I have to find her. I have to.

ROSS: Colonel, I really don't see anything for you to be concerned
about. I've met Senator Cretak and found her to be very cooperative. <br>
KIRA: For a Romulan. <br>
ROSS: Cretak's a strong supporter of the Alliance and we're going to
need that kind of support if we're going to win this war. <br>
KIRA: I wouldn't care if the Romulans were the only thing standing
between us and total annihilation. I would still think twice before
allowing them to establish a military presence here on the station. <br>
ROSS: We're just talking about a few offices for the senator and her
staff. <br>
KIRA: And a contingent of personal guards. <br>
ROSS: A dozen people at most. Besides, it's just a temporary
arrangement until the end of the war. <br>
KIRA: And when will that be? <br>
ROSS: Let's get one thing straight, Colonel. I came here as a courtesy
to you. This decision has already been made. <br>
KIRA: And I have to live with it. <br>
ROSS: That's right. You've done a fine job taking over for Captain
Sisko. <br>

advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least
thirty percent. <br>
WEYOUN: They should've been higher. Nevertheless, congratulations,
Damar. The enemy remains bottled up in the Chin'toka system and that's
where they'll stay until we destroy them. <br>
(Damar pours himself a drink.) <br>
DAMAR: I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm beginning to think you like it too much. <br>
DAMAR: I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar
every once in a while. <br>
WEYOUN: Tell me, Damar, when you're alone, do you even bother with a
glass, or do you just drink that swill directly from the bottle? <br>
DAMAR: Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We
owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. <br>
WEYOUN: Unfortunately, I agree. Somehow, releasing that Pah wraith into
the wormhole has shifted the momentum of the war into our favour. <br>
DAMAR: Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. <br>
WEYOUN: Not really. <br>
DAMAR: The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of
celestial battle. It's fascinating. <br>
WEYOUN: I never realised you had such a vivid imagination. <br>
DAMAR: There's a lot about me you don't know. <br>
WEYOUN: Just remember, too much imagination can be dangerous.

Square. She was, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman I'd ever
seen. Two months later, we were married. <br>

Sarah was your mother. <br>

I certainly was. Two days after your first birthday, she disappeared. <br>

SISKO: Why? <br>
JOSEPH: I've asked myself that question a thousand times. I never did
come up with the answer. <br>
SISKO: And you never found out what happened to her? <br>

Australia working as a holo-photographer. <br>
SISKO: Well, I have to speak with her. <br>
JOSEPH: You can't. <br>

before I tracked her down. I loved that woman and she loved me. I know

JOSEPH: I wanted to, many times. But you were so young when she left. <br>
SISKO: I grew up. <br>
JOSEPH: I thought that might make it easier, but it didn't. <br>
SISKO: That's no excuse. <br>
JOSEPH: I know. I'm sorry. But you see, you and your stepmother were so
close. She made you laugh like nobody else, and I didn't want anything
to get in the way of that. <br>
SISKO: I loved Momma. Nothing would've changed that. <br>
JOSEPH: She said the same thing. <br>
SISKO: You should have listened to her. <br>
JOSEPH: Life is full of choices. You make them and hope for the best.
Sometimes you're right, and sometimes you're not. I made a mistake. <br>
SISKO: Yeah, you did. <br>
JOSEPH: I still don't understand why the Prophets would send you a
vision of Sarah. <br>

do next. Maybe learning the truth about my mother is the first step of
this journey. <br>

hundred Jem'Hadar to get to the table. <br>
QUARK: Why does everything with Klingons have to involve bloodshed? <br>
BASHIR: No wonder he's been so frustrated with convoy duty. Maybe we
should talk to Admiral Ross. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah, I can see it now. Admiral, could you please send the
Defiant on the most dangerous mission you can think of? Jadzia needs to
get into Sto-vo-kor. <br>
QUARK: Sounds good to me. <br>
BASHIR: Then you ask him. <br>
O'BRIEN: What about General Martok? He's due to arrive on the station
tomorrow morning. <br>
BASHIR: Good thinking. Who better than a Klingon to help a Klingon?

SISKO: Actually, I was thinking about Jadzia. She always used to be
here to help me sort things out. I miss her. <br>
JOSEPH: I know you do. I came out to give you this. (a locket on a
chain) It was Sarah's. I want you to have it. I think she would have,
too. <br>
SISKO: Thanks, Dad. <br>
JOSEPH: There's some kind of writing on the back. <br>
(Sisko takes it under the door light to see.) <br>
JOSEPH: What's the matter? <br>
SISKO: This writing. It's ancient Bajoran. <br>
JOSEPH: What does it say? <br>

JOSEPH: I still don't understand why Sarah would have a locket with
Bajoran writing on it. I don't recall her ever mentioning Bajor to me. <br>
JAKE: Maybe she didn't know it was Bajoran. Maybe it was a gift from
someone. <br>
SISKO: Finally, some progress. <br>
JOSEPH: What is it? <br>
SISKO: The inscription. It says Orb of the Emissary. <br>
JAKE: I never knew there was an Orb of the Emissary. <br>
SISKO: I've never heard of it either. At least, there's no mention of
it in the Bajoran Ancient Texts. <br>
JOSEPH: Sounds like you've reached a dead end. <br>
SISKO: Not necessarily. What if the Orb does exist? What if it didn't
go dark like all the others when the wormhole disappeared? <br>
JAKE: If you can find it, maybe you can find a way to contact the
Prophets. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I'm going to find it. <br>
JOSEPH: But it could be anywhere. Where do you begin to look? <br>
SISKO: Tyree. <br>

KIRA: From the Dominion counterattack in the Chin'toka system. I'm
afraid that your people took the brunt of the assault. <br>
CRETAK: What matters is that we held our position. As for our
casualties, at least we now have the hospital complex on Derna to care
for the wounded. And we have you to thank, Colonel. <br>
KIRA: Oh, no. All I did was put in your request to the Council of

permission to dock at the Romulan hospital complex on Derna. <br>
KIRA: Well, the hospital may not be equipped to treat other species. <br>
ODO: I thought the same thing myself, until I noticed that most of the
wounded were Vulcans. Vulcans and Romulans share a common physiology. <br>
KIRA: And a mutual distrust of one another. That doesn't change just
because they're allies against the Dominion. <br>
ODO: True. But how do you explain these sensor readings? <br>
KIRA: High concentrations of trilithium isotopes. <br>
ODO: Which indicates the presence of Romulan plasma torpedoes. <br>

SISKO: He was a member of a cult that worships the Pah wraiths. They
believe that the disappearance of the Prophets will herald a new era
for Bajor. <br>
JOSEPH: I don't suppose I can talk you out of going to Tyree. <br>
SISKO: If you're worried about the cult <br>
JOSEPH: I figure you can handle them. But if the cult knows you're
looking for the Orb of the Emissary, chances are the Pah wraiths do as
well. And that does worry me.

QUARK: I don't see why you two are so happy. An entire Klingon fleet
failed to destroy the Dominion shipyards at Monac Four. What makes you

know, wherever it is that Trills go when their time is up. <br>
BASHIR: Miles, you don't understand. You weren't as close to her as I
was. This gives me a chance to honour her memory and I'm going to take

O'BRIEN: You know what this means, don't you? <br>

risking his life for a very dubious cause. <br>

CRETAK: This is ridiculous. I regret not informing your government
about our weapon emplacements, but I didn't think it was necessary.
We're your ally. <br>
