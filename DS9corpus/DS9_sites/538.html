KIRA: The Defiant searched the area for almost six hours. We couldn't
find any sign of survivors. <br>
SISKO: The Cortez was a fine ship. <br>
KIRA: You knew Captain Swofford a long time. <br>
SISKO: I introduced him to his wife. <br>
KIRA: Patrolling the Cardassian borders is getting more and more
dangerous. You never know when you're going to run into a squadron of
Jem'Hadar fighters. <br>
SISKO: I guess we popped the champagne cork too soon, hey? Everyone
thought the war was over when we retook the station and pushed the
Dominion back into
Cardassian space. <br>
KIRA: I never believed that and neither did you. <br>
SISKO: A lot of good that did the four hundred people on the Cortez. <br>
(Door opens.) <br>
KIRA: Ah, Mister Sisko. How do you like our station so far? <br>
JOSEPH: Well, it certainly is big. <br>
(Kira leaves.) <br>
JOSEPH: I heard about Quentin Swofford. I'm sorry. <br>
SISKO: Look, Dad, I know I haven't been very good company the last few
days. <br>
JOSEPH: I didn't come here to be entertained. I came to see you and
Jake. <br>
SISKO: Well, you certainly picked an interesting time to take your
first trip away from Earth. <br>
JOSEPH: Well, I figured it was now or never. Besides, I've been worried
about you. Last couple of times we've talked it seemed like you were
carrying the weight of the entire Alpha Quadrant on your shoulders. <br>
SISKO: Sometimes it certainly feels that way. Dad <br>
JOSEPH: Just say it, son. <br>
SISKO: I don't know how much more I can take. I don't know how many
more friends I can lose. Every time I achieve a real victory, something
like this happens and everything seems to turn to ashes. <br>
JOSEPH: So what do you want to do? <br>
SISKO: Maybe it's time for me to step down, let someone else make the
tough calls. <br>
JOSEPH: I see. No one is indispensable, son. Not even you. Whatever
decision you make, I'll support. Of course, if Quentin Swofford was
here I'd bet he'd have a few things to say to you. <br>
SISKO: But he's not here, and that's the whole point. <br>
JOSEPH: I'd say you have some thinking to do, and I've got a dinner
date with my grandson, so you'd better get to it. <br>

Ben. I'm not taking my ship anywhere near the Cardassian border. <br>
SISKO: I realise that, but the Dominion is getting bolder and bolder,
and your freighter is no match for a Jem'Hadar attack ship. <br>
KASIDY: Ah, they've got to catch me first. <br>
SISKO: You're really not worried, are you? <br>
KASIDY: No. I'm fearless, and you know that. That's why you love me. <br>
SISKO: I think I follow that logic. <br>
WILLIE: Hey, Benny. <br>

SISKO: I think so. <br>
JOSEPH: Thank God. <br>
JAKE: Hey, Dad, you scared us there for a minute. <br>
SISKO: What happened? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know. I'm reading some unusual synaptic potentials.
Your neural patterns are similar to those you experienced last year. <br>
SISKO: You mean when I was having those visions about Bajor? <br>
JOSEPH: Visions? Does this have something to do with those Prophets
you're always telling me about? <br>
KASIDY: He's not going to need surgery again, is he? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not sure yet, so I'd like you to remain overnight for
observation. <br>
SISKO: Is that absolutely necessary? <br>

I don't see the attraction. Spaceships, flying saucers, men from Mars. <br>
BENNY: What's wrong with men from Mars? <br>
VENDOR: Nothing, except it's all make believe. Me, I like war stories.
Did you see From Here to Eternity? Burt Lancaster standing there in the
middle of Pearl Harbour, machine gun blazing, shooting down those
Zeros. If it had been flying saucers, forget about it. So you going to
buy that or not? <br>

KAY: (Nana Visitor) Voila. A pitcher of plain water instantly becomes a
pitcher of iced tea. <br>
JULIUS: (Siddig El Fasil) Incredible. White Rose Redi Tea. What an
appalling concept. <br>
KAY: Oh, H. G. Wells would've liked it. <br>
JULIUS: I doubt that. No self respecting Englishman would. <br>

PABST: (Rene Auberjonois) What's wrong now, Herb? <br>
HERBERT: I'll give you one guess. <br>
KAY: The battle of the doughnuts, round twenty eight. <br>
PABST: That's it? That's what you called me out here for, to complain
about the doughnuts? <br>
HERBERT: They're stale again. <br>
PABST: Delicious. <br>
HERBERT: Delicious, my eye. These are two days old and you know it. <br>
PABST: I have been eating doughnuts my whole life. These weren't baked
more than six hours ago. <br>
HERBERT: That's it, I quit. I'm going over to Galaxy. <br>
PABST: Ha! Galaxy, that rag? <br>
HERBERT: I bet that rag knows the difference between a doughnut and a
doorstop. <br>
(Benny and Albert enter quietly) <br>
BENNY: Who's winning? <br>
KAY: A draw, same as always. <br>
PABST: You want to write Galaxy, go ahead, but they're not going to pay
you four cents a word for your stories. <br>
JULIUS: You're paying him four cents a word? <br>
ALBERT: Did you see where I put the er? <br>
BENNY: The matches? I gave them to you. <br>
JULIUS: If he's getting four, Kay and I should at least get three. <br>
HERBERT: For that fantasy crap you write, you're lucky to be getting
two. <br>
JULIUS: I beg your pardon? <br>
KAY: What's that? <br>
JULIUS: The latest Galaxy. <br>
KAY: Benny has the new issue of Galaxy. <br>
HERBERT: Let me see that. Heinlein, Bradbury, Sturgeon. Quite a lineup.
Add Herbert Rossoff to them and it'd be complete. <br>
PABST: What if I promise you fresh doughnuts tomorrow? <br>
HERBERT: Why should I believe you? <br>
PABST: I'll even throw in a couple of crullers. <br>
HERBERT: Okay, I'll stay. <br>
JULIUS: Don't do us any favours. <br>
PABST: Good. Now that we've finished with the old business, onto the
new. Time to hand out next month's story assignments. Ritterhouse!
We're waiting. <br>
(Enter the resident artist with paint stained smock.) <br>
ROY: (J G Hertzler) Okay, friends and neighbours. Let's see what Uncle
Roy has for you today. <br>
PABST: All right, I've titled this one 'Please, Take Me With You.' Who
wants it? <br>
(A little girl standing in the woods near a picnic table, staring at
two aliens in space suits.) <br>
KAY: Hmm, what do you think, Jules? <br>
JULIUS: I think we can do something with that. <br>
HERBERT: Oh, I bet you can. I can see it now, the lonely little girl
befriended by empathetic aliens who teach her how to smile. It's enough
to make you go out and buy a television set. Next. <br>
ROY: This is Mister Pabst's favourite. Honeymoon on Andoras. <br>
(A bug eyed monster climbing over the ledge of a building, where a
buxom beauty is sunbathing.) <br>
KAY: Oh, you've got to be kidding. <br>
ROY: What? So I had too much sauerkraut on my franks that night. What
can I say? <br>
HERBERT: Be that as it may, that is the worst piece of garbage I have
ever seen. <br>
ROY: Thank you. <br>
HERBERT: I'll take it. <br>
JULIUS: Of course you will. You have an affinity for garbage, don't
you? <br>
HERBERT: The picture may be garbage, but the story? The story will be
art. <br>
(A picture of Deep Space Nine) <br>
PABST: All right, I haven't got a title for this one yet. Anybody got
any ideas? <br>
BENNY: I'll think of something. <br>
PABST: All right, next order of business. Some of our readers have been
writing in wanting to know what you people look like. <br>
KAY: Write back and tell them we look like writers. Poor, needy and
incredibly attractive. <br>
PABST: Well our publisher has a better idea. Mister Stone has decided
to run a picture of you in next month's issue. <br>
ALBERT: Is this absolutely <br>
PABST: Necessary? I'm afraid it is. Kay, you can sleep late that day. <br>
KAY: Of course I can. God forbid that the public ever finds out K.C.
Hunter is a woman. <br>
BENNY: I suppose I'm sleeping late that day, too. <br>
PABST: It's not personal, Benny, but as far as our readers are
concerned, Benny Russell is as white as they are. Let's just keep it
that way. <br>
HERBERT: Oh yes, if the world's not ready for a woman writer, imagine
what would happen if it learned about a Negro with a typewriter. Run
for the hills! It's the end of civilisation. <br>
BENNY: What about W E B du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes,
Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright? Did you ever heard of Native Son? <br>
PABST: That's literature for liberals and intellectuals. The average
reader's not going to spend his hard earned cash on stories written by
Negroes. <br>
HERBERT: Would someone please shoot me and put me out of my misery? <br>
JULIUS: How I long for a gun. <br>
PABST: I'm sorry, Benny. I wish things were different, but they're not.
<br>
BENNY: Wishing never changed a damn thing. <br>
PABST: Come on, Benny. It's just a photo. <br>
BENNY: I'll try to remember that. <br>
HERBERT: You're a dog. <br>

Jackson last night and she's serious about retiring in the next couple
of years. I asked her about selling this place to us and she said that
she would be willing. <br>

CASSIE: And how much money have you earned doing that? <br>
BENNY: I've only been working at it for a few years. <br>
CASSIE: A few years? More like fifteen, if you count all those stories
you wrote in the Navy. <br>
BENNY: That was amateur stuff. <br>
CASSIE: Oh, baby, neither one of us is getting any younger. Can't you
see? This is our chance. We can make some money, we can get married.

not a crusader. I am not here to change the world, I'm here to put out
a magazine. Now, that's my job. That means I have to answer to the
publisher, the national distributors, the wholesalers and none of them

Really I am. <br>
JIMMY: I told you you were wasting your time. A coloured captain. The
only reason they'll ever let us in space is if they need someone to
shine their shoes. Ain't that right, Cassie? <br>
CASSIE: I don't know, and to be honest I don't much care what happens a
hundred years from now. It's today that matters. <br>
JIMMY: Well, I've got news for you. Today or a hundred years from now,
it don't make a bit of difference. As far as they're concerned, we'll
always be niggers. <br>
BENNY: Things are going to change. They have to. <br>
JIMMY: You keep telling yourself that. <br>
CASSIE: Maybe all this is happening for a reason. <br>
BENNY: You mean maybe it's God's way of telling me that I should quit
writing and go into the restaurant business? <br>
CASSIE: Hey, it's possible. Baby, I know we can make this work for us.
We could be happy. Besides, you don't have to give up writing
altogether. Maybe you could write something for the Amsterdam News or
some other Negro newspapers. <br>
BENNY: I'm not a reporter, I'm a writer. I write fiction and the
Amsterdam News is not going to publish stories about a space station
four hundred years into the future. <br>
WORF: Hear the game last night? <br>
(Benny starts up from his stool and knocks over a passerby.) <br>

BENNY: What way? I don't know what you're talking about. <br>

out of the darkness onto the path of righteousness. <br>

writing another one of those stories. You couldn't sell the last one.
What makes you think this one'll be any different? <br>
BENNY: It probably won't be, but it doesn't matter. It's what I've got

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PABST: Have you lost your mind? <br>
BENNY: Lately, I've been asking myself the same question. <br>
PABST: I give you a novella to write. I even offer you a shot at the
cover. Three weeks later, instead of a novella, you come back with six
stories. Six sequels to a story I refused to publish in the first
place. So I guess the answer to the question we've both been asking is
yes, you are certifiable! <br>
JULIUS: I think you should print your own stories. You know, through a
private publishing house. A nice, elegant, little volume. Fifty to a
hundred copies. <br>
PABST: That's a great idea. <br>
KAY: Might as well write it in chalk on the sidewalk. More people would
read them that way. <br>
ALBERT: I've got an idea. Why not make them, you know, a dream? <br>
BENNY: What's that? <br>
ALBERT: Just make the ending of your first story, Deep Space Nine, a
dream. <br>
BENNY: Would that make a difference? <br>
PABST: That depends.<br>
KAY: On what? <br>
PABST: On who's doing the dreaming. <br>
KAY: Well, obviously someone, er, someone without a lot of hope. A
shoeshine boy, a convict, someone dreaming of a better future. <br>
PABST: A Negro. <br>
DARLENE: Yeah well, I suppose he'd have to be if he was dreaming about
a Negro captain. <br>
HERBERT: Hold on. Making it a dream guts the story. <br>
PABST: Shut up, Herb. <br>
JULIUS: I think it makes it more poignant. <br>
HERBERT: What about the other Sisko stories? You can't make them all
dreams. <br>
KAY: Let him get this one published first, then he can worry about the
others. <br>

PREACHER: The light of the Lord is in his path. But, Brother Benny,
this is only the beginning of your journey, not the ending. And the
path of the Prophets sometimes leads into darkness and pain. <br>
CASSIE: Benny, what is he talking about? Who are you? <br>
PREACHER: I speak with the voice of the Prophets. <br>

live up to our usual high standards, unquote. <br>

going to have to get along without any Incredible Tales this month. <br>

layout? What high standards is he talking about? <br>

to publish this month, we don't publish this month. End of story. <br>

required here. <br>

BENNY: Well, you can't fire me. I quit. To hell with you, and to hell
with Stone. <br>
JULIUS: Try to stay calm, Benny. <br>
BENNY: No. I'm tired of being calm. Calm never gotten me a damn thing. <br>
PABST: I'm warning you, Benny. If you don't stop this I'm going to call
the police. <br>

anything to me. Not anymore. And nor can any of you. I am a human
being, damn it. You can deny me all you want but you cannot deny Ben
Sisko. He exists! That future, that space station, all those people,
they exist in here. In my mind, I created it. And every one of you know
it. You read it. It's here. You hear what I'm telling you? You can pulp
a story but you cannot destroy an idea. Don't you understand? That's
ancient knowledge. You cannot destroy an idea. That future, I created
it, and it's real.
Don't you understand? It is real! I created it and it's real! It's
real! Oh, God. <br>
