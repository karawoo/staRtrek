program to bypass the access protocols. <br>
KIRA: Unbelievable. The nerve. <br>
(Odo enters, bringing Quark.) <br>
QUARK: Major, you wanted to see me? <br>
ODO: Don't pretend you don't know what this is about. <br>
KIRA: Maybe this'll jog your memory. Engage monitor. <br>
(And an advert for Quark's comes up.) <br>
QUARK: Come to Quark's, Quark's is fun, come right now, don't walk,
run! Oh, I love the part where my name rotates around. <br>
ODO: Tampering with the station's comm. system is a class three
offence. <br>
QUARK: It's just a little advertisement. I didn't put one up in Ops. <br>
ODO: I'm sure the magistrate will take that into consideration when he
calculates your fine. <br>
(Worf enters, with a mug in his hand.) <br>
WORF: You! <br>
QUARK: As you can see, we're very busy here. Station business. <br>
WORF: How did you do it? <br>
O'BRIEN: Do what? <br>
WORF: I ordered a glass of prune juice from the replicator in the
Defiant's mess. This is what it came in. <br>
(The mug is emblazoned with Quarks. Free refill. Limit one per
customer. When tilted, the jingle plays.) <br>
KIRA: If all your little advertisements aren't purged from our systems
by the time I get back from the Gamma Quadrant, I will come to Quark's,
and believe me, I will have fun. <br>

BASHIR: According to Chief O'Brien the scan resolution on the new
sensors is amazing. We could practically do the entire bio-survey from
orbit. <br>
KIRA: Suits me. The sooner we get out of the Gamma Quadrant, the
better. <br>
BASHIR: How can you say that? Those little points of light out there
are the great unknown, beckoning to us. I wish I could visit every one.
<br>
KIRA: You might want to skip the ones with Jem'Hadar bases on them. <br>
BASHIR: Is it my imagination or are the stars a little brighter in the
Gamma Quadrant? <br>
DAX: Is it my imagination, or has Julian lost his mind? <br>
KIRA: Setting course for the Gavara system. <br>
(Later) <br>
KIRA: I'm picking up some kind of emergency signal. It's fragmented.
They say their homeworld's been attacked. Massive destruction, heavy
casualties. They're asking any passing vessel for assistance. <br>
DAX: Looks like the signal's coming from somewhere in the Teplan
system. <br>
BASHIR: That's just outside Dominion space. <br>
KIRA: Let's hope the Jem'Hadar know that. Setting new course. </font></p>

wrecked town. They walk along the main 'street'. The civilisation has
gone back to pre-industrial, but the locals don't really bother about
the strangers.) <br>
BASHIR: What happened here? <br>
(A woman with red prominent facial veins staggers out and collapses.) <br>
NORVA: Help me. Don't let me die here. Take me to Trevean. <br>
BASHIR: Trevean? <br>
NORVA: Hospital. <br>
DAX: I'll try to find out where it is. <br>
BASHIR: I'm going to give you something for the pain. <br>
EPRAN: (a young man) You're not from this world. <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
EPRAN: The Blight's quickened in her. There's nothing you can do. You
should leave here. now. Go back to where you came from and forget about
this place. <br>
(After the credits, Dax returns with her hair loose.) <br>
BASHIR: The painkiller I gave her isn't having much effect. But their
physiology's so different from ours, I doubt this blight is any danger
to us. <br>
DAX: I got us transportation to the hospital. <br>
BASHIR: How did you manage that? These aren't exactly the friendliest
people I've ever met. <br>
DAX: I gave her my hair clip. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hospital]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(More like a hotel lounge or restaurant, with
soothing music, dimmed lights, people sitting around in groups.) <br>
DAX: This is a hospital? <br>
ATTENDANT: She's quickened. Take her to Trevean. You're from another
world. <br>
(Another attendant carries Norva away.) <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
ATTENDANT: Well, don't worry. We'll take care of her now. <br>
DAX: I haven't seen a single person that doesn't have lesions on their
face. <br>
BASHIR: His look inflamed. So do that woman's over there. <br>
DAX: Like the woman we brought in. <br>
PATIENT: Trevean. Thank you for this. <br>
TREVEAN: You deserve nothing less. <br>
TAMAR: Yesterday, when I woke up, I saw that it had finally happened.
I'd quickened. I always thought I'd be afraid but I wasn't, because I
knew I could come here. Last night I slept in a bed for the first time
in my life. I fell asleep listening to music. This morning I bathed in
hot water, dressed in clean clothes. And now I'm here with my friends
and family. Thank you, Trevean, for making this day everything I
dreamed it could be. <br>
(Tamar toasts the doctor with his goblet and drinks deeply.) <br>
TREVEAN: You brought Norva here? <br>
DAX: How is she? <br>
TREVEAN: It was too late for her. If only she'd come sooner, I could
have helped. <br>
BASHIR: Then there is a treatment for the Blight? <br>
TREVEAN: There is no cure. It's always fatal. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, I don't understand. I thought you said you could
have helped her. <br>
TREVEAN: Why are you here? <br>
DAX: We received a distress call. We're here to help in any way we can.
<br>
BASHIR: I'm a doctor, and I have access to sophisticated diagnostic
equipment. <br>
TREVEAN: We had sophisticated equipment once. Do you think our world
was always this way? Two centuries ago, we were no different from you.
We built vast cities, travelled to neighbouring worlds. We believed
nothing was beyond our abilities. We even thought we could resist the
Dominion. I see you've heard of them. Then take care not to defy them
or your people will pay the same price we did. The Jem'Hadar destroyed
our world as an example to others. Bring me Milani's child. More than
anything, the Dominion wanted my people to bear the mark of their
defiance. So they brought us the Blight. <br>
(The baby has blue veins.) <br>
TREVEAN: We're all born with it. We all die from it. When the Blight
quickens, the lesions turn red. Death soon follows. Some in childhood.
Most before they can have children of their own. Only a few live to be
my age. <br>
BASHIR: Trevean, if you tell us what you know about the Blight, we may
be able to help. <br>
TREVEAN: No. You should go. If the Jem'Hadar find you here <br>
DAX: We're willing to take that risk. <br>
(Tamar has a seizure.) <br>
TREVEAN: Don't. <br>
BASHIR: Make some room. I'm a doctor. <br>
ATTENDANT: Leave him alone. You don't understand. <br>
BASHIR: Can't you see he's dying? <br>
TREVEAN: Of course he's dying. He came here to die. People come to me
when they quicken. I help them leave this world peacefully, surrounded
by their families and friends. <br>
BASHIR: What are you saying? <br>
TREVEAN: The herbs I give them causes death within minutes. <br>
DAX: You poison them? <br>
TREVEAN: The Blight kills slowly. No one wants to suffer needlessly.
Not like that woman you brought me. <br>
BASHIR: You killed her? <br>
TREVEAN: I did what she asked. <br>
BASHIR: I thought this was a hospital and that you were a healer. <br>
TREVEAN: I am. I take away pain. Now you've disrupted Tamar's death.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(People trundle wrapped bodies along on carts. A
young girl is staring at Bashir who is sitting on his own.) <br>
DAX: I found the distress beacon in an abandoned building not far from
here. It has its own power source. My guess is it's been repeating the
same message for over two hundred years. <br>
BASHIR: Well, there's nothing for us to do here. We should go. <br>
EKORIA: (pregnant girl) Are you really a doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
EKORIA: I've never met a doctor before. They say there's a woman in
Nykalia who makes a medicine that helps people withstand the pain of
quickening so they can live longer. I'd go there, but Nykalia's so far
away. <br>
BASHIR: When are you due? <br>
EKORIA: Not for another two months. <br>
DAX: That's not very long. <br>
EKORIA: We never know when the quickening will come. <br>
BASHIR: I'm Julian. What's your name? <br>
EKORIA: Ekoria. <br>
DAX: I'm Jadzia. <br>
EKORIA: Did you come here to help us? <br>
BASHIR: Nobody around here seems to want our help. <br>
EKORIA: I do. And I know others who would welcome it too. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Kira to away Team. <br>
DAX: Go ahead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Runabout]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: The sensors just picked up two Jem'Hadar
ships headed this way. <br>
(Bashir and Dax beam back up during the break.) <br>
KIRA: The Jem'Hadar are leaving the Kendi system and looks like they're
heading for the Obatta cluster. <br>
DAX: Sounds like they're on a patrol route which means this system is
probably next. <br>
KIRA: We'd better go. Stand by to get underway. <br>
BASHIR: Hold on, Major. We can't just leave these people. They need our
help. <br>
KIRA: And they'll get it. As soon as we get back we'll notify Starfleet
so they can put together a relief mission. <br>
BASHIR: But that could take weeks, maybe even months. We're here, now.
Remember the plague on Boranis Three? People were dying by the
thousands and nobody there knew why. It took us one hour to identify
the pathogen, and three days to dose the watertable and inoculate the
entire population. <br>
DAX: We might be able to do the same thing here. <br>
KIRA: All right, it's worth a try. We can't risk the Jem'Hadar
detecting the runabout. I'll take it to the Jenkata Nebula. <br>
BASHIR: Come back for us in a week. With any luck, we'll have a cure by
then.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHILD: They're here. They're coming. <br>
(Ekoria leads Dax, Bashir and their equipment to a curtained-off area
of the communal room.) <br>
DAX: Thanks. <br>
EKORIA: (to curious children.) Go. Go on. I'm sorry I can't offer you
more space. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, don't be. This is fine. Can I use this table to set up my
equipment? <br>
EKORIA: Whatever you need. <br>
(Dax picks up a painting.) <br>
DAX: Did you do this? <br>
EKORIA: My husband did. He died last winter. It's what he imagined our
world used to be like. He painted a mural similar to that on a building
near here. He traded a good pair of boots for the paint he needed. He
wanted to show people the way things were, he thought it might give
them something to work toward. <br>
DAX: Maybe later you can take us to see it. <br>
EKORIA: All right. <br>
DAX: Well, it looks like we have ourselves a clinic. <br>
BASHIR: The first thing I need to do is run a complete biospectral
analysis on an asymptomatic individual. <br>
DAX: Loosely translated, that means he needs a volunteer. Great. Now,
if you'll just have a seat, the doctor will be with you in a moment.
They love to keep you waiting. It makes them feel important. <br>
BASHIR: How would you like to see a picture of your baby? <br>
(Later, samples are being tested and analysed.) <br>
BASHIR: There it is! <br>
DAX: Let me see. <br>
EKORIA: What's happened? <br>
DAX: We've isolated the virus. <br>
EKORIA: Is that a good thing? <br>
BASHIR: It means we can start analysing its molecular structure, look
for binding sites so we can tailor an antigen. <br>
DAX: In other words, yes, it's a very good thing. <br>
BASHIR: I'm going to start mapping nucleotides. Can you run a protein
sequencer? <br>
DAX: I think so. <br>
EKORIA: I hope you two are hungry. <br>
BASHIR: Starving. <br>
EKORIA: Good. <br>
(Ekoria takes jars from a case she had kept in the sideboard.) <br>
DAX: That looks like a feast. <br>
EKORIA: It was supposed to be. <br>
DAX: What do you mean? <br>
EKORIA: Nothing. Do you like Takana root tea? <br>
DAX: Ekoria, where did you get all this food? <br>
EKORIA: I've been saving it for the hospital, for my death. Something
tells me I'm not going to need it anymore. </font></p>

his research.) <br>
BASHIR: Well, thanks anyway. She's not interested either. I hope Dax is
having better luck. <br>
EKORIA: I don't understand why you need people who've quickened to make
your cure. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I need to chart the progression of the viral (the young
man bumps into him) I'm sorry. <br>
EPRAN: (red veins) Oh, you're still here. <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
EPRAN: I see the Blight has spared you. Maybe it doesn't like the taste
of your blood. <br>
BASHIR: Unfortunately it seems to like yours. <br>
EPRAN: I'd invite you to my death, but we don't know each other that
well. <br>
BASHIR: What if I told you there was a chance you didn't have to die?
I'm a doctor. <br>
EPRAN: Don't tell me. You have a cure. <br>
BASHIR: I'm working on one. <br>
EPRAN: Yeah? What will it cost me? A good coat? A tilo of oil? <br>
BASHIR: It won't cost you anything. <br>
EKORIA: He can help us. Listen to him. <br>
BASHIR: I need volunteers, people who have quickened. <br>
EPRAN: What will you do? See how loud we scream when the Blight burns
through us? <br>
BASHIR: I have medicines that can dull the pain. I have equipment
unlike anything on your world. (to a boy) How would you like me to fix
that arm so you can play with your friends over there? I'm not going to
hurt you. (gets out the tricorder) You have got a fracture right here.
I bet it hurts. <br>
(Bashir runs a bone knitter over it and removes the sling.)<br>
BASHIR: Better? <br>
(The boy flexes his arm, grabs the sling and runs over to his friends.
The crowd are impressed.) <br>
EPRAN: How did you do that? <br>
EKORIA: Does it matter? He can find a cure for us if we help him. <br>
TREVEAN: Fixing a broken bone and curing the Blight are two different
things. <br>
BASHIR: I know that. <br>
TREVEAN: Others have come here with promises of a cure. They stirred up
hope, took food and clothing in exchange for their elixirs. But their
promises were always lies. And all those who believed them always came
to me in the end, begging for release. <br>
BASHIR: I just want to do what I can to help. I'm not making any
promises. <br>
TREVEAN: Take care that you don't. Because we've dealt with those who
give false hope before. Believe me, their deaths make the Blight look
like a blessing.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EKORIA: What's wrong? <br>
BASHIR: I'm trying to chart the life-cycle of the virus. It would be a
lot easier if I'd gotten more tissue samples. <br>
EKORIA: Maybe you should go home. Maybe my people don't deserve your
help. <br>
BASHIR: They've just been suffering so long they've lost hope that
things can be better. <br>
EKORIA: It's more than that. We've come to worship death. I used to
wake up and look at myself in the mirror, and be disappointed that I
hadn't quickened in my sleep. Going to Trevean seemed so much easier
than going on living. <br>
BASHIR: But you don't feel that way anymore. <br>
EKORIA: Not since the baby. My little boy. Can your machines tell me
what he's going to look like when he grows up? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, no, not really. <br>
EKORIA: Maybe he'll look like his father. I want to be here for him. To
hold his hand when he takes his first step. Kiss his knee when he
scrapes it in a fall. <br>
BASHIR: Well, with any luck, you'll see him have children of his own. <br>
DAX: Julian. There are some people here who'd like to see you. <br>
(Epran has brought two other quickened people.) <br>
EPRAN: I suppose you're going to want to bleed me? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, a little. <br>
EPRAN: I cancelled my death for you. I was really looking forward to
it. <br>
(Time passes. It is night and the divisions in the room have come down
to make a full scale ward) <br>
BASHIR: All right, everyone gets three milligrams, including you.
(Ekoria injects herself.) Perfect. <br>
(Epran is in great pain, so Dax puts the device on his forehead.) <br>
DAX: There this'll dull the pain. <br>
EPRAN: I like your spots. <br>
DAX: You told me that yesterday. <br>
EPRAN: I still like them. <br>
DAX: Julian. Epran has stopped responding to the cordrazine. I had to
put him in an inhibitor field. <br>
BASHIR: He's further along than everyone else. I'm hoping he'll be the
first to respond to the antigen. Think of it. She may well be holding
the cure in her hands. Do you think we should tell her what she's
giving them? <br>
DAX: She's nervous enough about using the hypo. It's better if we wait
until we're positive. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose. <br>
DAX: You should take a break. You've been working non-stop for days.

EKORIA: Doctor? <br>

another twelve percent. <br>
BASHIR: That's great news. <br>
EKORIA: It is? <br>
BASHIR: Trust me. <br>
EKORIA: I do. I did from the start. I don't really know why. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I'd like to think it's my bedside manner. Doctors and
nurses are supposed to project an air of caring competence. You were
doing it in there. <br>
EKORIA: Me? <br>
BASHIR: I was watching you. You're very good with patients. <br>
EKORIA: I was just trying to be kind. <br>
BASHIR: Well, some people don't like to be around the sick. It reminds
them of their own mortality. <br>
EKORIA: It doesn't bother you? <br>
BASHIR: Sometimes. I prefer to confront mortality rather than hide from
it. When you make someone well, it's like you're chasing death off,
making him wait for another day. <br>
EKORIA: But death comes to everyone in the end. <br>
BASHIR: Except Kukalaka. <br>
EKORIA: Kuka-who? <br>
BASHIR: My first patient. A teddy bear. <br>
EKORIA: What's that? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, it's a sort of a soft puppet. Anyway, when I was a boy I
took him everywhere I went. After a few years, he became a little
threadbare until eventually his leg tore and some of the stuffing fell
out. My mother was all set to throw him out, but I wouldn't have it,
because at the tender age of five, I performed my first surgery. I
re-stuffed him and sewed his leg closed. From that day on, I did
everything I could to keep Kukalaka in one piece. I must have sewn and
stitched and re-patched every square inch of that bear. <br>
EKORIA: Why were you so determined to keep him together? <br>
BASHIR: Well, I wouldn't be much of a doctor if I gave up on a patient,
would I? <br>
EKORIA: Where's Kukalaka now? <br>

BASHIR: I remember running a haematology scan on Epran the other day.
There were changes in the viral base-pair sequence, and I didn't know
why. <br>
DAX: There's no way you could've known it was because of our
instruments. <br>
BASHIR: I should have put it together. <br>
DAX: That's not fair. <br>
BASHIR: Isn't it? I'm going to tell you a little secret, Jadzia. I was
looking forward to tomorrow, to seeing Kira again and casually asking,
how was the nebula? And oh, by the way, I cured that Blight thing those
people had. <br>
DAX: It's not a crime to believe in yourself, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: These people believed in me and look where it got them. Trevean
was right. There is no cure. The Dominion made sure of that. But I was
so arrogant I thought I could find one in a week. <br>
DAX: Maybe it was arrogant to think that. But it's even more arrogant
to think there isn't a cure just because you couldn't find it.

BASHIR: Ekoria, wait. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Bashir and Dax have beamed up. Kira stays sitting
down to hide her growing
bump. Nana is visibly pregnant with Sid's child by now.) <br>
KIRA: You're sure about this? <br>
BASHIR: I can't leave these people. Not now. <br>
KIRA: Whenever you're ready, contact the station. We'll have a runabout
here within days. <br>
DAX: You know what worries me, Julian, is that without me you won't
have anyone to translate for you. Good luck. <br>
BASHIR: Major.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ekoria is bedridden and Bashir is doing things the
old-fashioned way with bubbling beakers and a
Bunsen burner .) <br>
EKORIA: What is it? <br>
BASHIR: There isn't a trace of the antigen I gave you in your
bloodstream. Your immune system must've rejected it. <br>
(Ekoria gasps with pain.) <br>
BASHIR: Is it bad? I can give you another hypo, but you've so much
cordrazine in your system already it might be hard on the baby's
metabolism. <br>
EKORIA: I'll wait. <br>
(And one morning.) <br>
EKORIA: What is that smell? <br>
BASHIR: I'm making a salve. <br>
EKORIA: As long as I don't have to drink it. <br>
BASHIR: How do you feel? <br>
EKORIA: I've been better. <br>
BASHIR: Can you sit up? <br>
(He uses a tube to listen to her chest.) <br>
BASHIR: Breathe. Again? Now let's see how the baby's doing. His head's
over here now. <br>
EKORIA: I'm not surprised. Feels like he's turning somersaults in
there. <br>
BASHIR: His heart's getting stronger every day. I'd say another six
weeks. <br>
EKORIA: I'll never make it that long. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I can induce labour in two weeks. The baby will be old
enough by then. <br>
EKORIA: Two weeks. <br>
(And later, one night, Trevean is painting the salve on her lesions.) <br>
EKORIA: Trevean. Am I dead? <br>
TREVEAN: Is that what you want? I can end your suffering. Your child
will have known nothing but peace. <br>
EKORIA: No. He deserves a chance to live. <br>
TREVEAN: The Blight will take him in the end. <br>
BASHIR: Trevean. I didn't realise you made house calls. <br>
TREVEAN: I was concerned that she might be too weak to come to me. <br>
BASHIR: I don't understand why you're so obsessed with death. From what
I've heard, you've lived with the Blight longer than anyone. <br>
TREVEAN: Yes, and I've seen more suffering than anyone else. Goodbye,
Ekoria. I hope you live long enough to see your baby. <br>
(Trevean leaves.) <br>
EKORIA: Trevean means well. He's a kind man, in his own way. <br>
(And now Ekoria is giving birth.) <br>
BASHIR: Push! Good. Good. Now breathe. Don't stop breathing. Don't stop
breathing. Breathe. I can see his head. And push! Push! Yes, push. Yes.
Yes. <br>
(New life has arrived, crying, and with no lesions.) <br>
BASHIR: My God. That's why there's no antigen in your system. It's all
been absorbed through the placenta. Ekoria, he doesn't have any
lesions. He doesn't have the Blight. <br>
(Bashir gives her the child. She looks at him and dies.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Bashir shows the baby to Trevean and his
attendants.) <br>
TREVEAN: You found a cure. <br>
BASHIR: It's not a cure, it's a vaccine. Every pregnant woman should be
inoculated with it as soon as possible. It won't help them, but it will
protect their babies. <br>
TREVEAN: Our children won't have the Blight? <br>
BASHIR: The vaccine isn't difficult to make, but seeing that everybody
gets it will be a huge task. <br>
TREVEAN: Oh, not a task, a privilege. Can you show me how to make it? <br>
BASHIR: I was hoping you'd ask that. <br>
(Bashir hands the child to Trevean.
