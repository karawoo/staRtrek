Captain's log, stardate 51474.2. The Defiant has been ordered to
investigate a rare subspace compression phenomenon recently discovered
in Federation space. This scientific assignment is a welcome change
from months of combat duty against the Dominion. Three of my officers
are taking a runabout into the anomaly's vortex. The runabout and it's
crew will be subjected to severe spatial distortion, so we have
activated a tractor beam to minimise the effect. </font>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: So, how small are they? <br>
NOG: The miniaturisation process won't begin until the runabout reaches
the edge of the accretion disc. <br>
KIRA: I see. And then they'll begin to shrink? <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: Major, are you laughing at our investigation of this subspace
anomaly? <br>
KIRA: No, sir. <br>
WORF: The data collected here could provide Starfleet with the key to
creating transwarp corridors through space. It could give us a
substantial tactical advantage over the Dominion. <br>
KIRA: It's very important research. What? I'm not laughing. Just
because we are shrinking three people to the size of coffee cups. <br>
(And collapses in hysterical laughter.) <br>
NOG: Smaller, actually. <br>
WORF: I do not see what is so humourous about being small. <br>
NOG: Neither do I. <br>
(Comm. beep.) <br>
SISKO: On screen. <br>
NOG: Their visual signal's degrading, Captain. We have audio only. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead, Rubicon. <br>
DAX [OC]: We're about to enter the accretion disc. <br>
SISKO: I wish were with you, old man. <br>
DAX [OC]: (static starting to break in) I'll send you a postcard. Tell
Worf I look forward to hearing his poem. I'll bet it'll be inspiring.
We'll talk to you again once we've left the accretion disc and reversed
the effects of the compression. Rubicon out. <br>
SISKO: Good luck, Rubicon. <br>
NOG: We've lost their signal, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Ensign. Mister Worf. Poem? <br>
WORF: It is an ancient Klingon tradition to commemorate an important
event with a poem. Jadzia asked me to compose one for this occasion. <br>
SISKO: Well, what have you got so far? <br>
NOG: They've penetrated the accretion disc. <br>
KIRA: Now is it my imagination, or did the kid just cover for him? <br>
SISKO: This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. <br>
WORF: They are getting smaller. <br>
NOG: Even the space within their subatomic structure is shrinking. <br>
KIRA: I wonder what it feels like.

BASHIR: Well, believe it or not, you're about a metre tall and
shrinking fast. In a few minutes, you're going to be half the size of a
comm. badge. <br>
O'BRIEN: There's a comforting thought. <br>
BASHIR: The gamma ray flux is increasing. We should close the blast
shutters. <br>
DAX: Take a last look. We're on sensors from here on. <br>
O'BRIEN: Now you're certain we'll return to normal size once we clear
the anomaly? <br>
DAX: Our probes did. You saw the data. Something wrong? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, I'm fine. I'm just not in love with the idea of being
small. What are you smirking at? You're as small as I am. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, you're sitting one point one four metres closer to
the focal point of the anomaly, which means you've shrunk point zero
four percent more than I have. <br>
(Weird noise and shudder.) <br>
DAX: What was that? <br>
O'BRIEN: The tractor beam's fluctuating. Something's wrong.

KIRA: Radiation from the vortex must have masked their warp signature. <br>
SISKO: Return fire, Mister Worf. Ensign, pull the Rubicon out of there.

(Boom!) <br>
WORF: Phasers are offline. <br>
(Boom!) <br>
KIRA: We're a sitting duck as long as we're tethered to the runabout. <br>

Worf, go down to auxiliary control and target the phasers manually. <br>

O'BRIEN: That was the easy part. <br>
DAX: Well, the good news is we're alive, so we must have escaped the
anomaly. <br>
O'BRIEN: The bad news is the external sensors and the comm. system are
down. I can patch around most of the damage, but it'll take time. <br>
DAX: Better add the blast shutters to your list. I can't get them open.
<br>
(Bashir finishes treating Dax's head injury.) <br>
BASHIR: There you go. Good as new. <br>
DAX: I don't suppose that thing'll work on our communications system? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm picking up the Defiant's transponder signal. We can home
in on that. <br>
DAX: Going to one quarter impulse. Chief, either open these shutters or
give me external sensors, whichever's quicker. I need to see where

KUDAK'ETAN: Tactical report. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: The bridge officers are confined in the mess hall, other
survivors in the cargo bay. We will have impulse power back online in
thirty minutes, but it will take several hours to restore warp
capability. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: It must be gratifying for an Elder to end his career with a
victory. I feel privileged to be here with you at such a moment. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: There is still much to do before we declare victory. Until
we leave Federation space, we are vulnerable <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: I am First. And I have declared victory. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: It is, of course, your prerogative. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: Open a channel to the Vorta. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Yes, First. <br>
JEM'HADAR [OC]: We have the boarding party. <br>
GELNON [on viewscreen]: Ah, First. Your report? <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: The Defiant is ours. <br>
GELNON [on viewscreen]: Good. Very, very good. I must admit, I was
initially quite sceptical about you and the other new Jem'Hadar bred in
this quadrant, but this is a most impressive debut. Wouldn't you agree,
Elder? <br>
IXTANA'RAX: The takeover of the ship was competently executed. <br>
GELNON [on viewscreen]: Do I detect a note of jealousy in your voice?
I'm sure it must be difficult for you to watch a new race of Jem'Hadar
beginning to supplant you and the other members of the old guard. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: I serve the Founders. If it is their will to create a new
race, then that is the order of things. <br>
GELNON [on viewscreen]: But? <br>
IXTANA'RAX: But the Jem'Hadar bred here in the Alpha Quadrant have not
proven themselves superior to those from the Gamma Quadrant. At least
not yet. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: Not yet? It was the Alphas who made this victory possible.
If it were not for us, you would never <br>
GELNON [on viewscreen]: You two can argue about this on your own time.
First, how long until you restore warp power? <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: I will make a complete survey of the ship and give you a
report in one hour. <br>
GELNON [on viewscreen]: Very well. I await your report. <br>
(Transmission ends) <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: Bring me Captain Sisko. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: I would suggest that his execution can wait until we have
completed repairs to the ship. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: I'm not going to execute him. Are you about to question my
order, Second? <br>
IXTANA'RAX: No. Obedience brings Victory. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: And Victory is Life. <br>

anyone tracking us. <br>

KIRA: Thanks. That's enough. <br>
WORF: I should have foreseen this. I should have sent out
reconnaissance probes to scan for enemy ships. Or a shuttle. Or
recalibrated our sensors. If I had, Jadzia <br>
NOG: None of that would've done any good. The Jem'Hadar approached us
from the anterior angle of the
anomaly. Their warp signatures <br>
KIRA: He's just trying to tell you <br>
WORF: I do not need him to tell me anything. <br>
SISKO: Everybody settle. First of all, we don't know what happened to
the Rubicon. For all we know they got out of the anomaly on their own.
If they did, they're headed home and in much better shape than we are.
So let's hold off on analysing our mistakes for now. <br>
KIRA: If they restore warp power, we'll be analysing them from inside a
Dominion prison camp. <br>
SISKO: Restoring warp power might not be so simple for them. It took us
a week just to learn how to pilot one of their ships. We might have a
chance to retake the Defiant, but we can't do anything unless we can
get out of this room. Suggestions? <br>
(Ixtana'Rax enters.) <br>

(It's the Defiant, and compared to Rubicon, it is massive.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I thought you said we'd return to our normal size once we left
the anomaly. <br>
BASHIR: We should have. <br>
DAX: We didn't leave the anomaly by the same path at which we entered
it. <br>
BASHIR: So the process failed to reverse itself. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you telling me that I'm going to be this bloody tall for
the rest of my life? (five centimetres) <br>
BASHIR: This bloody tall, actually. (one centimetre) But don't worry.
All we have to do to regain our original size is re-enter the anomaly
and follow our original trajectory back out. <br>
O'BRIEN: In theory. <br>
BASHIR: In theory. <br>
DAX: I'll tell you what isn't a theory. We're going to need the
Defiant's help to re-enter the anomaly. <br>
BASHIR: With communications out, how do we get their attention? <br>
DAX: Fly up to a window and knock? <br>
O'BRIEN: Wait. If we're this big, that means the Rubicon is what, this
big? (ten centimetres) <br>
BASHIR: More or less. <br>
O'BRIEN: And the Defiant's aft plasma vent is this big? (double the
Rubicon) <br>
DAX: Are you suggesting that we take the Rubicon inside the Defiant? <br>
O'BRIEN: Why not? Getting past the anti-backflow valve might be tricky,
but once we're inside we've a better chance of attracting someone's
attention than we do sitting out here. <br>
DAX: I love it. Let's go.

KUDAK'ETAN: Good. Captain Benjamin Sisko. The one the Bajorans call the
Emissary. I am First Kudak'Etan. In a strange way, you are the reason I
exist. If you had not eliminated our fleet in the wormhole, there would
have been no need to breed Alpha Quadrant Jem'Hadar. <br>
SISKO: You didn't bring me here to say thank you. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: No. The impulse engines sustained only minor damage in our
attack, but the warp drive was severely damaged. I need your technical
expertise in order to repair it. Bring Captain to the engine room so he
may begin necessary repairs. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: It's a mistake. Giving him access to the engine room will
only give him an opportunity to retake the ship. In fact, he's working
on a plan at this very moment. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: I was not aware that telepathy was a Gamma characteristic. <br>
IXTANA'RAX: I know what he's thinking because it's exactly what I would
be doing in his position. You should kill him now, before he has a
chance to put his plan into motion. <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: You are the Second. I am the First. Do not presume to tell
me what to do. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad the two of you worked that out. Now, what makes you
think I'm going to help you? <br>
KUDAK'ETAN: Your choice is to repair the warp drive or watch me execute
your crew one at a time. Have Sixth Duran'Adar select one of the
prisoners for execution and bring him to the bridge! <br>

KUDAK'ETAN: How many? <br>
IXTANA'RAX: I strongly suggest that you refuse this request. <br>
SISKO: You have the weapons. Are you afraid you can't handle a few
unarmed prisoners? <br>
IXTANA'RAX: I won't be baited by a prisoner, and neither should you. <br>
SISKO: Okay. I'm in no hurry to reach a Dominion prison camp. if you
want me to teach your men how to repair the warp drive, that's fine
with me. We'll begin with primary command and control systems. That
should take about six hours. Then we will move up to basic engineering
theory for a class seven warp drive. Then <br>
IXTANA'RAX: Enough. <br>

all. And I am not interested in any more of your suggestions. Now take

lockout so he can release the command codes. If he can do that, the
Captain can control the entire ship from the operations console. Nog's

here. <br>

BASHIR: Relax, Miles. You wouldn't be able go out there even if you
wanted to. You wouldn't be able to breathe. The oxygen molecules
outside are almost two thousand times larger than anything your
