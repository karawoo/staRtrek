SISKO: I didn't expect to find you here. I thought you'd be down on the
Promenade, helping Mardah put up the decorations for the Bajoran
Gratitude Festival. <br>
JAKE: That was the plan, but it turns out I don't have much to be
grateful for. <br>
SISKO: Isn't that the earring you <br>
JAKE: Bought for Mardah. Yeah, you want it? Maybe you can give it to
Major Kira for her next birthday or something. <br>
SISKO: All right, tell me about it. <br>
JAKE: Mardah's gone, Dad. She got accepted to the Science Academy on
Regulus Three. <br>
SISKO: That's a good school. <br>
JAKE: It's three hundred light years away. <br>
SISKO: Jake, you're sixteen. Take my word for it, you'll survive.
Sooner or later you'll find someone else. Who knows, maybe you'll find
someone tonight at the Gratitude Festival. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, sure. <br>
SISKO: Jake, the whole point of the Festival is to put all your
troubles behind you and make a new start. <br>
JAKE: I could use one. Okay, I'll go. <br>

BASHIR: Nervous and irascible. <br>
O'BRIEN: If you hadn't seen your wife and child for two months, you'd
be irascible too. <br>
BASHIR: Believe me, I'm looking forward to Keiko and Molly's visit just
as much as you are. <br>
O'BRIEN: I doubt that. <br>
BASHIR: How many games of racquetball have we played in the last two
months? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know. Fifteen, maybe twenty. <br>
BASHIR: No, try seventy. I've been keeping track of that, too. And you
know what all those games have proved to me? That I'm a poor substitute
for your wife. <br>
O'BRIEN: I could've told you that sixty games ago. Thing is, they're
only going to be here for two days. That's barely enough time to say
hello. Then they're back to Bajor again for four more months. <br>
BASHIR: Four months. Why that's another hundred and fifty games of
racquetball. I don't think my elbow can take that kind of abuse. Maybe
you can try and convince her to stay. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, no. I can't do that. I'm the one who suggested she go on
this agrobiology expedition in the first place. No, we're just going to
have to make the best of the little time we have. Which means we can't
waste a second of the next two days. </font></p>

ODO: Actually, I was thinking of joining you this year. <br>
KIRA: Really? <br>

ODO: I usually make it a point to drop by Quark's three or four times a
day at random intervals, just to let him know that I'm thinking about
him. But seeing today is a holiday, he'll be busier than usual. I
suggest you station a man there full time. I think that about covers

ODO: You heard about that? <br>
LWAXANA: Odo, don't worry. I'm here to help you. <br>
ODO: What kind of help do you mean? <br>
LWAXANA: A sympathetic ear, a shoulder to cry on. A lap to melt in. <br>
ODO: Well, that's very considerate of you, but unnecessary. My people
are who they are, and I am who I am. I've learned to accept that. <br>
LWAXANA: You brave soul. Why don't we go someplace quiet, and you can
tell me all about it. <br>
ODO: Actually, I was planning to attend the opening of the Gratitude
Festival this afternoon. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, well, even better. First a little fun and relaxation, and
then we can delve into the depths of your pain. I'll freshen up, and
meet you in front of the Bajoran Temple for the Presider's opening
address. I promise you, Odo, you'll never be alone again.

KIRA: I think she asks your advice just so that she can do the exact
opposite of what you recommend. <br>
BAREIL: I know you don't like Winn, but the office has changed her. The

capable hands and concentrate on enjoying ourselves? <br>
KIRA: I have to go. <br>
BAREIL: The Festival doesn't start for an hour. <br>
KIRA: But I have to set up the Renewal scrolls along the Promenade. But
it won't take long. Jadzia's promised to help me. <br>
BAREIL: Jadzia, of course. I've never understood how the two of you
could be such good friends. She's so unpredictable and you're so <br>
KIRA: Predictable? <br>
BAREIL: I didn't mean it like that. It's just that she gets to spend so

BAREIL: I have to find Jadzia. <br>
KIRA: Jadzia? Is something wrong? <br>
BAREIL: No, not at all. Do you know where she is? <br>
KIRA: She's probably on the Promenade. <br>
BAREIL: She wasn't there the last time I looked. <br>
KIRA: Why is it so important for you to see Jadzia? <br>
BAREIL: I'll explain everything later. Thank you, Nerys. <br>
KIRA: For what? <br>
BAREIL: For being such a good friend. <br>
KIRA: Friend?

SISKO: Dax, what are you doing here? <br>
DAX: I thought you might need some help getting ready for the party. <br>
SISKO: Thanks, but that won't be necessary. Wouldn't you rather be
celebrating on the Promenade? <br>
DAX: No, thanks. I don't want to run into Vedek Bareil. <br>
SISKO: Is there a problem between you? <br>
DAX: He can't keep his hands off me. <br>
SISKO: That doesn't sound like Vedek Bareil. <br>
DAX: I couldn't believe it myself, but he wouldn't leave me alone. He's
probably still out there looking for me. <br>
SISKO: Have you told Kira? <br>
DAX: I don't know how. It's going to break her heart. <br>
SISKO: Someone has to tell her. Do you want me to do it? <br>
DAX: Would you? <br>
SISKO: Well, if you think that's the best way to handle it. <br>
DAX: I'd really appreciate it, Benjamin. I mean, this whole thing is
ridiculous. How could I be interested in Bareil? We both know it's
always been you. <br>
(Dax snuggles up on Sisko's lap.) <br>
SISKO: Dax? <br>
DAX: Mmm? <br>
SISKO: What are you doing? <br>
DAX: Making myself comfortable. Have I ever told you that you smell
wonderful? <br>
SISKO: You know, old man, I have to admit you had me going there for a
minute. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, stop acting so coy. There's no one around. I have an
idea. You cancel the party, and then that way we can spend the evening
alone together. What do you say? <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Bashir. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: Go ahead, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Meet me in the Infirmary immediately. <br>

KEIKO [OC]: Not now, Miles. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're right. I'm an idiot, sometimes. When I don't get my
way, I can be selfish and childish and pigheaded. I said some things to
you that were pretty stupid. I wish I could take them back. But even if
it's too late for that, there's one thing I want you to know, Keiko. I
love you. I always have, and I always will. I want you to know I've
left a letter of resignation on Commander Sisko's desk. I'm ready to
move down to Bajor with you tomorrow, if you'll have me. And after that
if you want to move back to Earth, that's okay too. I'll do whatever it
takes. I just don't want to lose you. Honey, did you hear what I said? <br>
KEIKO [OC]: Yes. <br>

KIRA: So did I. But it turns out he'd rather be with Dax than me. And
to make matters worse, I have Jake Sisko chasing me around the station,
professing his undying love. <br>
BASHIR: That's strange. A little while ago, Jadzia had Commander Sisko
convinced that she was in love with him. He even had me examine her to
make sure she was all right. Apparently it was only a joke. <br>
KIRA: Are you sure? People are acting very strangely today. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe I should take another look at Jadzia's test results.
Excuse me. Constable, Would you tell Commander Sisko that I'll be a
little late? <br>
(Lwaxana gets an ache. and so do Bashir and Kira.) <br>

impossible. That only effects older Betazoids. <br>
BASHIR: That may be, but according to my tests you show all the
symptoms. Zanthi Fever is a virus which effects the empathic abilities
of mature Betazoids. It causes them to project their own emotions onto
others. <br>
SISKO: Then Mrs Troi's amorous feelings for someone on the station were
being passed along to the people around her. <br>
BASHIR: Not everyone. Only those within close proximity to her when she
had an attack. And even then there would have to have been some
pre-existing latent attraction. <br>
