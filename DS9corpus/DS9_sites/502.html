I had no idea it would turn the entire conference upside down. Believe
me, Jake, panel discussions between doctors are usually a lot more
civilised than that. <br>
JAKE: I don't know. They seemed polite enough to me. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, that was just a veneer. That paper stepped on quite a few
toes, I can tell you. It's heresy to even consider the possibility that
prion replication could be inhibited by quantum resonance effects.
Aren't you going to take any notes? <br>
JAKE: Good idea. <br>
BASHIR: According to the so-called experts, it's all a matter of amino
acid re-sequencing and disulfide shuffling. Quantum dynamics has
nothing to do with it. <br>
JAKE [OC]: I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about. <br>
BASHIR: (underneath) But how can that be? After all, peptide bonds can
be reconfigured on a <br>
BASHIR: Quantum level. Ah, now get this. This is very good. A few
months ago <br>
JAKE [OC]: If I don't find a way to get out of doing this article, my
first writing assignment is going to be my last. Maybe if I write to
The Journal and explained. Dear editors, thank you for the confidence
expressed in my by accepting my proposed profile of Doctor Bashir.
Unfortunately <br>
BASHIR: (underneath) I was running a neural scan and noticed some
anomalous protein readings. I thought there must be some mistake, so I
ran an at the Journal and amino acid sequence to be sure. But there it
was again, the prion mutation rate had spiked. I couldn't believe it.
It meant the anomalous proteins had to have a strong quantum resonance.
<br>
BASHIR: Do you follow? <br>
JAKE: Sort of. <br>
BASHIR: Good. Because that's the key. The protein anomalies. They
indicate a correlative <br>
JAKE [OC]: Who cares about anomalies? People want stories about things
they can relate to. Life and death, good and evil. An outbreak of
Cartalian fever would be just the thing. The brave doctor battles the
deadly virus. Listen to me, I'm actually rooting for a plague. <br>
BASHIR: (underneath) Increase in prion replication. And that can only
mean one of two things either the peptide bonds are unstable, or some
other factor is causing the mutations. Rather than start the labourious
process of running <br>
BASHIR: Quantum scanning each and every peptide bond, I thought I'd
begin to make some kind of <br>

BASHIR: It's a distress call from the Federation colony on Ajilon
Prime. They're under attack. The Klingons have landed troops. <br>
JAKE: So much for the cease fire. <br>
BASHIR: The main hospital's been damaged. They're short on doctors and
running low on supplies. <br>
JAKE: What are we waiting for? Let's go. <br>
BASHIR: It's risky. The hospital's only fifty kilometres away from the
front line. <br>
JAKE: You put yourself into dangerous situations all the time. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe, but that's not the same as putting you into one. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry about me. <br>
BASHIR: You're too young to die, Jake. <br>
JAKE: I'm eighteen. You know what I mean. I've been on the station when
it was under attack plenty of times. I can handle myself. I'm a Sisko.
There are lives at stake. These people need you. <br>
BASHIR: I hope I don't regret this. We'll be there in just under an
hour. I can only imagine what your father's going to say. <br>
JAKE: He'll understand. <br>
BASHIR: I'll get you out of there as soon as reinforcements arrive.
Besides, I wouldn't want you to miss the deadline on your story. Do you
think they want a picture of me? Anyway, about those quantum scans I
was telling you about. <br>
JAKE [OC]: Surgery Under Fire. Now we're talking. <br>

to me that I could scan for irregularities in the </font></p>

QUARK: The Chief asked me to come up with a decaffeinated raktajino for
Kira. I'm thinking of marketing it. <br>
(Kira takes a mouthful.) <br>
KIRA: Ugh, ugh, ugh that's awful. <br>
O'BRIEN: Give it a chance. Let me taste. <br>
(A long mouthful then) <br>
O'BRIEN: Quark! <br>
QUARK: I did the best I could. The removal of caffeine from beverages
has plagued bartenders and restauranteurs for centuries. You can't
expect me to solve it overnight. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not paying for that. <br>
ODO: So much for Quark-tajino. <br>
O'BRIEN: I want to get her off caffeine, not poison her. <br>
KIRA: You make me sound like some kind of addict. <br>
DAX: She has maybe two raktajinos a day. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, I just don't want my son to be born with a caffeine
habit, that's all. <br>
DAX: You're being ridiculous. Why does pregnancy always make men
hysterical? <br>
O'BRIEN: Excuse me, this is not the first baby I've had. <br>
KIRA: Excuse me. Keiko had Molly. <br>
DAX: It's not up to you to tell Kira what she can and cannot do. <br>
WORF: She is carrying his child, he should have some say. <br>
QUARK: As the lessee, he does have certain rights. Back home, pregnancy
is considered a rental. <br>
KIRA + DAX: Rental? <br>
(Sisko enters from his office) <br>
ODO: Something wrong, Captain? <br>
SISKO: I just talked to Doctor Bashir. He's on his way to Ajilon Prime
to answer a request for medical assistance. <br>
KIRA: Jake's with him. <br>
SISKO: According to the latest reports, Klingon ground troops have
captured two settlements in the northern hemisphere. <br>
WORF: Half the colonists are still trapped on the planet. There are no
ships in the area to evacuate them. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're three days away at best. <br>
SISKO: The Farragut will get there the day after tomorrow. Bashir says
that he and Jake will leave as soon as the relief teams are in place. <br>
DAX: That means they'll be home by Thursday. Doesn't give you much time
to snoop through Jake's things.

JAKE: Ready to beam down? <br>
BASHIR: No, we can't leave the runabout in orbit, not with the Klingons
around. Besides, the colonists moved what was left of the medical
equipment underground when the hospital was destroyed and there's
magnesite in the rock face. There's no way to transport through it. <br>
JAKE: I guess we'll have to find a place to set down. <br>
BASHIR: Looks like there's a clearing about a kilometre away from the
main settlement. Jake, things could get a little rough down there.
They've got a lot of wounded. <br>

NURSE: I'll need that plasma! <br>
KALANDRA: (a woman) Are you Bashir? <br>
BASHIR: We got a distress call. <br>
KALANDRA: Resource said you were on your way. <br>
KIRBY: Watch it! Watch it! This is the last IP. <br>
NURSE: His pulse is thready. He must be bleeding somewhere. <br>
KIRBY: We are losing him! <br>
NURSE: Doctor Kalandra. <br>
KALANDRA: Bashir, jump in. Standard triage. Give him fifteen mils
inoprovaline. <br>
JAKE: What should I do? <br>
BASHIR: Just keep out of the way, please. <br>
KALANDRA: Get this man into surgery! <br>

with war wounds.) <br>
BOLIAN: The artery's severed. Her BP's bottomed out. <br>

JAKE: Somebody! This man needs help! <br>

disruptor blast real close. <br>
BOLIAN: I need that blood plasma! <br>
BASHIR: (to Ensign) Let's get you up on the table. <br>
KALANDRA: (to Jake) There's nothing we can do. He's too far gone. <br>
BASHIR: It doesn't look that bad. <br>
ENSIGN: I was stepping over a Klingon. I thought he was dead. He got me
right in the foot. You people better get out of here while you still
can. The Klingons, there's no stopping them. <br>
BASHIR: This is a phaser burn. <br>
ENSIGN: What are you talking about? <br>
BASHIR: Just sit tight. We'll get to you as soon as we can. <br>
ENSIGN: It's not a phaser burn! (to Jake) It was a Klingon. You weren't
there. You don't know what it's like. The Klingons had us pinned down.
We were done for. We all knew it. Hendriks and Pajal, they got scared.
They ran. They ran! Then Sully got hit in the leg and the medics pulled
him off the line. And all I could think was, I wish I were him. And I
took my phaser. Oh, God! What did I do to myself? What did I do? <br>
BOLIAN: Find someplace else to stand. <br>
JAKE: No problem. <br>
JAKE [OC]: Triage, the sorting of the wounded, forces decisions that. I
got to get a grip. Focus. Decisions that test what it means to be a
doctor. <br>
KIRBY: Hey, you! Give me a hand. Come on! Come on! I've got to get some
plasma for this guy. Keep an eye on him for me. I'll be right back. <br>

ODO: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
SISKO: Yes, I hear you took a little trip to the Infirmary. <br>
ODO: I'll be fine. The only permanent damage was to my pride. <br>
SISKO: What happened? <br>
ODO: Quark wanted me to keep an eye on two Yridians who he suspected
were cheating at dabo. Turned out he was right. I could see from the
second level that one of them was using a miniature gravimetric scanner
to predict where the ball would land on the wheel, and signalling the
information to his partner. <br>
SISKO: Ingenious. Go on. <br>
ODO: I started down the stairs to make the arrest. One of them spotted
me. They bolted, I pursued. I'm afraid I got a bit carried away. <br>
SISKO: And jumped off the stairs. <br>
ODO: I was planning to change form in mid-air and become a Tarkalean
condor. <br>
SISKO: That would have been impressive. <br>
ODO: I thought so. <br>
SISKO: It's an understandable mistake. You've been a changeling longer
than you've been a solid. <br>
ODO: Solid. I wonder why my people use that term. Humanoid bodies are
so fragile. <br>
SISKO: Yes, they are. And there are a lot of ways you can get hurt. <br>
ODO: You're worried about Jake. I'm sure that Doctor Bashir is looking
after him. <br>
SISKO: It seems just yesterday he was five years old, clinging to me
because he'd just scraped his knee and I was the only one in the world
who could make it better. I remember sometimes getting up in the middle
of the night and slipping into his room just to make sure he was all
right, and I'd sit there and watch him sleep. And I'd think to myself
that no matter what, I
wasn't going to let anything bad happen to this child. Now he's a
sector away in a war zone, and there's nothing I can do to protect him.
<br>
ODO: Try not to worry, Captain. It won't do you or Jake any good. <br>
SISKO: Can't help it. It comes with the territory. <br>
ODO: But Jake is eighteen years old. Does your father still worry about
you? <br>
SISKO: Oh, all the time. <br>
ODO: Ah. I never realised how stressful it is to be a parent. I have to
say, I don't think it's for me. <br>
SISKO: That's your choice, but you don't know what you're missing. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
SISKO: Yes? <br>
DAX: We just got word. The Klingons have destroyed the Farragut near
the Lembatta cluster. <br>
ODO: What about Ajilon Prime? Without reinforcements <br>
SISKO: Dax, you're with me. We'll leave as soon as the Defiant is
ready.

KIRBY: Don't worry about it. Same thing happened to me my first day.
You know what I heard? That ship Starfleet sent, the Farragut? The
Klingons intercepted it. <br>
JAKE: Starfleet'll send another one, won't they? <br>
KIRBY: It won't be here for days, and in the meantime we're looking at
a ground war which is just what the Klingons want. According to a
lieutenant I talked to, they've got so many transport scramblers online
that we can't beam troops anywhere. <br>
JAKE: What about using hoppers? <br>
KIRBY: He says the Klingons have been shooting them out of the sky left
and right. Unless something changes, he figures the Klingons'll take
the settlement the day after tomorrow. Did you see all the bat'leth
wounds today? Klingons get mad, they forget about their disruptors, go
hand to hand. If you ask me, they're looking to get even for what
happened on Ganalda Four. <br>
JAKE: What happened? <br>
KIRBY: They had to retreat. Klingons hate that. <br>
JAKE: At least we don't have to worry about them in here. <br>
KIRBY: Don't be so sure. Medical personnel are fair game as far as
Klingons are concerned. They'll even kill wounded right in their beds.
They think they're giving them an honourable death. So, how'd you wind
up here? <br>

all I could think about was how close the Klingons were.<br>
(It's later, everyone else is asleep and Jake is writing.) <br>
JAKE [OC]: He didn't seem that worried. No one else seems to be losing
sleep over it, so why is it the only thing I can think about? I've been
on the station when it was under attack plenty of times, but somehow
the danger never seemed as real as it does here. Maybe it's because I
spent all day seeing firsthand what the Klingons are capable of, or
maybe it's because for the first time in my life, my father's not here
to protect me. <br>

JAKE: No. <br>
BURKE: They made it! <br>
JAKE: Who? <br>
BURKE: My platoon. The Klingons had us pinned down. We couldn't beam
out because they had a transport scrambler running. We called for a
hopper. As soon as it set down, the Klingons came after us. CO ordered
me and Brice to lay down cover so the squad could get up the ramp. By
the time Brice got in, the Klingons were practically on top of us. The
hopper was taking such a pounding, I didn't think it would make it off
the ground. <br>
JAKE: You stayed behind on purpose, so they could get away. <br>
BURKE: The hypo, where is it? <br>
JAKE: It's empty. <br>
BURKE: Figures. <br>
JAKE: I'll get you out of here. I'll make a stretcher <br>
BURKE: With what? <br>
JAKE: Then I'll carry you. <br>
BURKE: Kid, you try carrying me, my guts are going to spill all over
your shoes. <br>
JAKE: But I have to do something. I've got to try. <br>
BURKE: Forget it. <br>
JAKE: But I have to. That way this'll all make sense. Maybe I ran for a
reason, so I could find you and save your life. <br>
BURKE: Ran? <br>
JAKE: From the explosions. We had to get to the runabout for the
generator, and the shelling started and I couldn't see Doctor Bashir
and the explosions, they kept getting closer. I had to get out of
there, so I ran. I ran and I kept running until I found you. <br>
BURKE: The doctor. You left him. <br>
JAKE: It was a mistake. <br>
BURKE: That's what you call it. <br>
JAKE: I didn't mean for it to happen. <br>
BURKE: And now you think bringing me back is going to make everything
all right. Sorry, kid. Life doesn't work like that. <br>

SISKO [OC]: I'll be right out. <br>
(Sisko comes out of a Jefferies tube.) <br>
DAX: What have you been doing in there for three hours? <br>
SISKO: I was just tweaking the pattern buffers in the replicator
systems. <br>
DAX: Great. I always thought the coffee could be a little hotter. <br>
SISKO: I'm just trying to keep busy. <br>
DAX: Is it helping? <br>
SISKO: No, not really. <br>
DAX: I wish there was something I could do, some way I could promise
you that everything is going to be okay. <br>
SISKO: But you can't. No one can. <br>
DAX: I know what it's like to worry about a child. Raifi put Tobin
through hell. When Neema was six, she came down with Rugalan fever.
Audrid spent two weeks in the hospital with her, never left her side.
It was hundreds of years ago. I still remember how helpless I felt. I
read her all seventeen volumes of Caster's Down the River Light, even
though I knew she couldn't hear me. It made me feel like I was doing
something, that we were still connected. It wasn't until much after
that that I realised that I was doing it as much for me as I was doing
it for her. <br>
SISKO: Just to keep busy. So, how did it turn out with Neema? <br>
DAX: She pulled through. <br>
SISKO: Phew. I was hoping you were going to say that. Because if this
story had an unhappy ending, I would have never forgiven you. <br>
DAX: Of course, by the time she was twenty one, she wouldn't even speak
to me. <br>
SISKO: For how long? <br>
DAX: About eight years. <br>
SISKO: Do me a favour. Tell me about it some other time. Right now, all
I care about is seeing Jake. <br>
DAX: You will, tomorrow, when we get to Ajilon Prime. You know, Ben,
coffee can never be too hot. Are you sure you got the replicator
buffers synchronised? <br>
SISKO: You want to check for yourself? <br>
DAX: I think I will. Can I borrow your decoupler? <br>
SISKO: Get your own. I have to check the sonic shower relays. <br>
DAX: Good idea.

were <br>
JAKE: I'm okay. <br>
KIRBY: This is great. What happened? <br>
JAKE: I got knocked out when we were trying to get to the runabout. Did
Doctor Bashir make it back all right? <br>
KIRBY: He's in IC for the night. He's got plasma burns on his arm and
shoulder. I don't know how he managed, but he carried the generator
back here by himself. We went looking for you right after the shelling
stopped. There was hardly anything left of the runabout. The whole
place was nothing but bomb craters and smoke. We had pretty much given
up hope. <br>
JAKE: I must've wandered off in the wrong direction when I came to. <br>
KIRBY: You're lucky you didn't get picked up by the Klingons. Word is,
they're massing to attack the compound. You want to see him? <br>
JAKE: I should let him rest. <br>

you're okay.

assumed the worst. I am so sorry. <br>
JAKE: It's all right. <br>
BASHIR: No. No, it isn't. I should never have brought you here in the
first place. Now we're stuck here, the Klingons are massing to attack.

JAKE [OC]: I couldn't stand hearing him apologise to me like that. Not
after what I'd done to him. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAKE [OC]: I keep turning it over in my head. The
shelling, losing sight of Bashir, running, and I keep trying to make
sense of it all, to justify what I did. But when it comes down to it,
there's only one explanation. I'm a coward. Part of me wishes Bashir
had seen me run away and told everyone the truth. They deserve to know
what I am. They should know they can't count on me. That if the
Klingons attack, I'll run and hide just like I did before. </font></p>

NURSE: Oh, thanks Jake. Would you take this to the patient in G-four? <br>
JAKE: Sure. <br>
NURSE: Thanks. <br>
(G4 is the self-mutilation Ensign. Jake offers him the tray of food.) <br>
JAKE: Here you go. <br>
ENSIGN: Maybe I'll get a job as a cutter. Could be interesting work. <br>
JAKE: What's a cutter? <br>
ENSIGN: You know, on a mining team. They're the ones who split the
asteroids up with phasers so the excavators can get at what's inside.
You've got to have good aim. No matter what else you can say about me,
you can't say that I don't have good aim. If I hadn't hit my foot just
right, I would've taken my whole leg off. It's funny. One minute your
life's moving along just like you always thought it would, and the next
you do something that changes everything, that makes you realise you're
not who you thought you were. At the Academy, I did really well in the
battle simulations. I never had any problems. But when you're out there
and the live shells are detonating all around you, it's a whole
different thing. <br>
JAKE: All you can think about is getting away from the explosions. <br>
ENSIGN: Yeah. That's pretty much it. You know something? You're first
person I've talked to since I got here who hasn't made me feel like I'm
taking up valuable bed space. The way everyone looks at me. I can't
stand it. After the court martial, I'm definitely signing up for the
next mining expedition to the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
JAKE: Maybe there won't be a court martial. <br>
ENSIGN: You're right. None of us may get out of here alive. <br>
JAKE: No, I mean Starfleet could decide to send you to counselling
instead. <br>
ENSIGN: I won't go. I don't deserve to be in Starfleet. Therapy won't
change what I did. Nothing will. I just wish I'd aimed that phaser a
little higher. </font></p>

NURSE: I saw the report on Doctor Kalandra's desk. According to
Resource, it's just a matter of time before the Klingons reach the
compound. <br>
KIRBY: I guess that means I have to decide. <br>
NURSE: Decide what? <br>
KIRBY: Whether I'd rather get hacked to bits or blasted by a disruptor.
<br>
NURSE: Disruptor, no doubt about it. Every molecule in your body
vaporised in a flash. No time to feel pain. <br>
BOLIAN: Don't be so sure about that. Some people think it's like being
boiled alive. <br>
KIRBY: Decapitation has its virtues. Nice clean blow with a sharp
bat'leth. <br>
BOLIAN: The brain lives on for five, ten seconds at least. In theory,
your headless corpse could be the last thing you see. <br>

slit <br>
JAKE: Cut it out! <br>
KIRBY: I was just kidding. <br>
JAKE: You think this is some joke. It's not. People are dying! It's all
so stupid. This whole stupid war is such a waste. In ten years, no
body's going to remember what anybody did here. <br>

KIRBY: That tunnel is almost two kilometres long. We have over seventy
