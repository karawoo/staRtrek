BASHIR: So there I was, fighting the toughest battle of my life,
looking around hoping to spot a friendly face only to discover my
colleagues were gone. I was alone. I admit, for a moment there, I
considered giving up. I could feel the seconds ticking away, panic
building up inside of me. I knew my only chance was to trust my
instincts. So I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and just like that
it came to me, the answer I was looking for. A pericardial membrane. I
looked down and punched the answer into my computer terminal just as
the buzzer sounded ending the exam. And that, I suppose, is the stuff
salutatorians are made. <br>
WOMAN: Salutatorian? <br>
BASHIR: Well, I mistook a preganglionic fibre for a postganglianic
nerve during the orals or I would have been valedictorian. It was a
trick question. <br>
WOMAN: Fascinating. <br>
BASHIR: Not nearly as fascinating as when I <br>
SISKO [OC]: Doctor Bashir. Chief O'Brien. Report to landing pad five. <br>
BASHIR: Bad timing. <br>
WOMAN: There'll be another time. <br>
(O'Brien and Bashir start to leave) <br>
BASHIR: Starfleet medical finals. Gets them every time.

hand) <br>
KIRA: It's no use. <br>
SISKO: Chief, we have to get this hatch open. Lieutenant Dax and Ensign
Pauley are trapped in there. <br>
KIRA: The runabout barely made it back through the wormhole. By the
time they docked, power levels were near zero. <br>
O'BRIEN: There's not even enough juice left in the ship to release the
servos. <br>
BASHIR: Life support's down. Oxygen levels have dropped dangerously
low. <br>
KIRA: (drawing her weapon) We'll have to burn it through. <br>
SISKO: Forget it Major. The hatch is made of duranium composite. It'll
take you an hour to get through. <br>
BASHIR: We don't have that much time. That's odd. How many passengers
did you say were onboard the Ganges? <br>
SISKO: Two. <br>
BASHIR: I'm reading three. <br>
O'BRIEN: We need to get power to the hatch servos. Major, hand me the
EPI capacitor. There, middle shelf. <br>

O'BRIEN: Miles O'Brien, from the Enterprise. <br>
VASH: Oh. Yes, of course. <br>

DAX: We found her in the Gamma Quadrant. She'd been there for over two
years. <br>
O'BRIEN: Two years? <br>

VASH: Thank you, Doctor. I try. <br>
BASHIR: I, I, I mean you've managed quite well considering you've been
out of contact with civilisation for over two years. <br>
VASH: I'd hardly call the Gamma Quadrant uncivilised. Some of the
cultures I've encountered have histories that date back millions of
years. <br>
BASHIR: Really? I'd love to hear about them. I mean, we have no idea
what's beyond the wormhole. <br>
VASH: Well, maybe I'll write a book. <br>
BASHIR: It's sure to be a best-seller around here. Well, er, no sign of
disease or malnutrition or parasitic infections. <br>
VASH: You sound disappointed. <br>
BASHIR: I am. Now I have no reason to keep you here. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: And she claims she knew nothing about the
wormhole? <br>
DAX: She did seem very surprised when I told her about it. I don't
think she ever expected to see this part of the galaxy again. <br>
SISKO: How could she get there in the first place if she didn't go
through the wormhole? <br>
DAX: She said she didn't want to talk about it. Said it was a personal
matter. <br>
SISKO: This doesn't make sense. A human alone in the Gamma Quadrant for
two years? Let's check her background. See what we can find out about
her. <br>
DAX: She claims to be an archaeologist. <br>
SISKO: That's a good place to start.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VASH: You're sure this place is safe? <br>
CLERK: The Assay office is the most secure area on the station. The
chambers are surrounded on all sides by individual force fields. <br>
VASH: And how are the locks controlled? <br>
CLERK: Once you secure a chamber, it can't be opened except with your
personal authorization code combined with a verified retinal print. <br>
VASH: A Cardassian MK-seven scanner? <br>
CLERK: MK-twelve, with an L-ninety enhanced resolution filter. <br>
VASH: Well, I suppose that'll have to do. <br>
CLERK: Computer, begin inventory for cubicle nineteen. One statue,
stone, thirty odd centimetres tall, approximately eight kilograms.
Assorted gems. Gold necklace. One dagger, bronze and gold, about twenty
five centimetres. <br>
(Vash opens a box to reveal a large orange crystal with an inner light)
<br>
CLERK: Beautiful. I've never seen anything quite like it. Some kind of
Promethean quartz. <br>
VASH: I thought so too, at first, but it's molecular density and
refraction index is much higher. <br>
CLERK: Remarkable. End inventory. Please, enter an access code. <br>
(Vash taps in some digits then does her retina scan. The drawer shuts.)
<br>
VASH: All right, I'll be back tomorrow to pick everything up. I've
booked passage on the Mulzirak Transport. <br>
SISKO: You're not leaving us so soon? <br>
VASH: I'm afraid so.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: The Daystrom Institute will be very
disappointed. <br>
VASH: The Daystrom Institute? <br>
SISKO: Their scientists are anxious to hear about life in the Gamma
Quadrant. Every place you've been, everything you've seen, no matter
how insignificant, could prove important. Including how you got there. <br>
VASH: I'm sorry, Commander, but that's a <br>
SISKO + VASH: Personal matter. <br>
(Quark is talking to the Assay office junior assistant) <br>
VASH: So now the Daystrom Institute is interested in me. well, that's
ironic. <br>
SISKO: Professor Woo seemed especially eager to speak to you again. <br>
VASH: Did he really? I suppose he told you that he suspended my
membership from the Institute's Archaeological Council? <br>
SISKO: On two occasions. Something about the sale of illegal artefacts.
<br>
VASH: Well, when it comes to choosing between science and profit, I'll
choose profit every time. <br>
SISKO: The professor was hoping you'd make an exception in this case. <br>
VASH: You know, I haven't been back to Earth in, it must be twelve
years. <br>
SISKO: Here's your chance. I could arrange passage. <br>
VASH: I think I'd like that. <br>
SISKO: Fine. I'll take care of it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: I don't understand it, Commander. I can't
find anything wrong with her. This ship is completely functional. <br>
SISKO: It didn't look that way this morning. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, don't get me wrong. The power reserves are empty, the
inertial damping fields are barely operational, and the warp drive
containment field's on the verge of collapse. <br>
SISKO: But <br>
O'BRIEN: But there's nothing wrong with any of them. Once we put power
back into her, she should be fully operational. <br>
SISKO: Did you check the central power linkages? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I ran a level one diagnostic. Everything checks out.
I can't explain it. It's like something tapped into the ship's systems
and drained them dry.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Tell me Chief, how well do you know this
woman Vash? <br>
O'BRIEN: Hardly at all. I only met her that one time she was aboard the
Enterprise. <br>
SISKO: What was she doing there? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well Sir, Vash and Captain Picard were friends. Close friends,
if you follow my meaning.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Status report? <br>
DAX: We suffered a broad spectrum power drain. <br>
KIRA: Power transfer is completely inoperative. The energy was drawn
out faster than it could handle. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll have to replace the whole unit. <br>
DAX: Chief, are you reading any graviton flux around the transfer
systems? <br>
O'BRIEN: I am detecting a low level graviton disturbance. How did you
know? <br>
DAX: That's exactly what happened when we lost power on the Ganges.

quarters. The bed may take some getting use to. <br>
VASH: As an archaeologist, I've spent half my life sleeping in tents.
To me, any bed will be a luxury. <br>
O'BRIEN: You've obviously never slept on a Cardassian mattress. If you
need anything, just ask the computer. <br>
VASH: Thanks, Chief. Oh, by the way, how's Jean-Luc? <br>
O'BRIEN: The Captain? The last time I saw him he was fine. <br>

Q: Really, Vash, I can't believe you're still pining for Jean-Luc, that
self righteous do-gooder. <br>
VASH: I should have listened to him. He warned me about you. <br>
Q: You're hurt, you strike back. I understand. But be of good cheer, I
bring wonderful news. I'm back. I can see now it was cruel of me to
leave you. <br>
VASH: Very touching. But you didn't leave me, I left you. <br>
Q: You left me, I left you Details, mere details. The important thing
is we're back together again. A team, joined together at the hip. <br>
VASH: Not a chance. <br>
Q: You know you're going to miss me. <br>
VASH: Don't flatter yourself. <br>
(Q gets all her stuff back into her bag so she has to unpack again) <br>
Q: You know, I thought first we'd visit the Teleris Cluster, look in on
the star dancers at Mundahla. Or maybe head over to the Lantar nebula
and view the Sampalo relic on Hoek Four. <br>
VASH: Not interested. <br>
Q: I know. Vadris Three. Charming little world. The natives think
they're the only intelligent life in the universe. <br>
VASH: No. <br>
(Her bag is back on her shoulder so she throws it at him) <br>
Q: All right, you choose then. <br>
VASH: I choose never to go anywhere with you again, Q. <br>
Q: You don't know what you're missing. When we started this little
partnership, I promised to take you places no human had ever seen
before. <br>
VASH: And you have. It was wonderful. Thank you. Now goodbye. <br>
Q: Two years in the Gamma Quadrant hardly qualifies as a grand tour of
the universe. There's still the Delta Quadrant to explore, not to
mention all the other galaxies. <br>
VASH: It's over, Q. I want you out of my life. You are arrogant, you
are overbearing and you think you know everything. <br>
Q: But I do know everything. <br>
VASH: That makes it even worse. <br>
Q: All right, fine, what is it you really want? <br>
VASH: I want the life I had before I met you. <br>
Q: And a stellar life indeed. The eminent Vash. Barred from the Royal
Museum of Epsilon Hydra Seven, persona non grata on Betazed. Wanted
dead on Myrmidon for stealing the Crown of the First Mother. <br>
VASH: Dead or alive. <br>
Q: Preferably dead. It's a wonder you haven't offended every sentient
race in the galaxy. <br>
VASH: You're the one who almost got me killed on Errikang Seven. And
they weren't exactly thrilled to see you on Brax either. What did they
call you? The God of Lies? <br>
Q: They meant it affectionately. <br>

Q: What business could you possibly have with that disgusting little
troll? <br>

back this instant. <br>
Q: All right. <br>
(Q disappears, Quark reappears) <br>
VASH: Can I help you? <br>
QUARK: My name is Quark. It's come to my attention that you have access
to certain items. Items that might perhaps turn a tidy profit. <br>
VASH: I'm listening. <br>
QUARK: For a percentage, I might be able to arrange a buyer for your
trinkets. Perhaps an auction. <br>
VASH: I'll only accept payment in gold-pressed latinum. <br>
QUARK: I'll shower you in it. Fifty-fifty. <br>
VASH: Mister Quark, I believe you're trying to take advantage of me. <br>
QUARK: Some wine? <br>
(Vash takes hold of his lobes) <br>
QUARK: (ecstasy). You have a talent for oo-mox. <br>
VASH: So I've been told. <br>
QUARK: I'll not be distracted by your feminine wiles. I demand forty
percent. <br>

VASH: What magnificent cartilage. <br>
QUARK: Twenty two and don't stop. <br>

arrangements. <br>

meeting me, it's no wonder you ended up with Picard. <br>

Q: Aren't we the hub of activity? <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? <br>
VASH: No. Come in, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. And please, call me Julian. <br>
VASH: Julian. Is this medical business? <br>
BASHIR: Well, to tell the truth, I tried to come up with some official
reason for dropping by, but your excellent health has robbed me of any
excuses. <br>
VASH: Well, that didn't seem to stop you. <br>
BASHIR: So I thought I'd contribute to your good health by buying you
dinner. Quark's makes a delicious couscous, and the company, I hope,
might be mildly entertaining. <br>
VASH: Sounds like fun. (Q appears behind Julian and pulls faces) Though
I would like to freshen up first. Could I meet you there in, say,
twenty minutes or so?
(Q vanishes) <br>
BASHIR: Those twenty minutes will seem like an eternity. <br>
(Bashir leaves, Q is back) <br>
Q: These mating rituals you humans indulge in really are quite
disgusting. <br>

In fact, I'm having dinner with her now. <br>

KIRA: Main power grid has dropped eighty percent. <br>
DAX: Sensors are reading a massive graviton build-up. <br>
SISKO: How long will it take to bring us back up to full power? <br>
DAX: It's already beginning to normalise. <br>
KIRA: You know, if we have one of these outages during a docking
procedure, we could lose an entire pylon. <br>
O'BRIEN: I've double-checked every system. For the first time in a
month, there's nothing wrong with any of them. It's got to be Q.

you're used to. But just so it's not a total loss, I'll take it off
your hands for, say, seven bars of gold-press latinum. <br>

question. Is Starfleet penalising you or did you actually request such
a dismal command. <br>
SISKO: I want you off this station. <br>
Q: Don't be hasty, my happy-go-lucky friend. This dreary little gulag
could use a little colour, some excitement. And who better to provide
it than moi? Though I must say I approve of your new tailor. <br>

Jean-Luc knows how to turn a phrase <br>

with a breach in one of our reactor cores. We'd lose half the station. <br>

station with ionised tridium gas, we should be able to trace the

O'BRIEN: Tridium? Isn't that pretty toxic. <br>
DAX: Only when it's highly concentrated. We'd only use a very small
