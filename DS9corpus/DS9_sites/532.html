KIRA: Captain Boday? You want me to bring Captain Boday to your
quarters for dinner? <br>
DAX: It's just a suggestion. <br>
KIRA: It's a bad suggestion. Number one, you used to go out with
Captain Boday. Number two, Worf hates him. And number three, and we
have discussed many times, Captain Boday has a transparent skull. <br>
DAX: And you don't like to see a man's brains. <br>
KIRA: Ops.

he has a good physique, and he has a very opaque cranium. <br>
KIRA: True. But his eye bothers me. <br>
DAX: Which one? <br>
KIRA: The middle one. <br>
DAX: Really, you are obsessed with appearances. <br>
KIRA: And sometimes your taste in men frightens me.

WORF: Tell me what? <br>
DAX: Don't be so nosy. You can always invite Odo. <br>
KIRA: I'm not ready for that. Odo's not ready for that. Let's just
forget that you brought that one up. Two raktajinos, extra strong, and
a kava roll. I'm coming to dinner alone, got it? <br>
DAX: I got it. Three place settings. <br>
KIRA: I'll bring the wine. <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain, you'd better get out here. <br>
SISKO: What is it? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm showing a power buildup in the transporter buffer. <br>
DAX: Someone's attempting to beam into Ops. <br>
SISKO: From where? <br>
DAX: I don't know. There are no ships within transporter range. <br>
(A crouching man beams in.) <br>
KIRA: Are you hurt? <br>
(The man turns and points a disrupter at Kira. OMG look who it is!) <br>
BAREIL: No, but you'll be unless you do exactly what I say. <br>
KIRA: It can't be. <br>
(After the opening titles, Bareil is holding Kira as a shield, but
she's staying as limp as possible.) <br>
SISKO: What do you want? <br>
BAREIL: A fast ship would be nice. <br>
SISKO: Security, we have a hostage situation. Clear a path to landing
pad A. Authorisation Sisko seven one green. <br>
ODO [OC]: Seven one green acknowledged, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Your runabout's waiting. <br>
BAREIL: Let's go. <br>
SISKO: If you hurt her you will never leave this station, I promise you
that. <br>
BAREIL: Follow me and she dies. I promise you that. <br>
(At Kira's desk) <br>
BAREIL: Hold it. <br>
(He picks up her roll and eats it.) <br>
BAREIL: Not the turbolift. Someone might cut the power and we'd be
trapped inside. <br>
KIRA: Then we walk.

You're not with the Alliance, are you? <br>
KIRA: There is no Alliance here. <br>
BAREIL: Then I have crossed to the alternate universe. Tell you one
thing, the food's better. <br>
KIRA: So I take it you're running from the Alliance. <br>
BAREIL: Now you know the story of my life. <br>
KIRA: So once you get your ship, what then? <br>
BAREIL: Believe me, wherever I end up is going to be a lot better than
where I've been. <br>
KIRA: I can believe that. I've spent some time in your universe. <br>
BAREIL: I'll bet you were glad to leave it. Now which way? <br>
KIRA: That way. <br>
BAREIL: How many levels before we reach the landing pad? <br>

BAREIL: (gasping) Open it. <br>
KIRA: I've got a better idea. Why don't you hand over that disruptor? <br>
BAREIL: Oh, you've been so cooperative up to now. I'd hate to have to
kill you. <br>
KIRA: You're not going to kill me. <br>
BAREIL: Oh, you sure of that? <br>
KIRA: You're not going to kill anyone. Not with that disruptor. Power
cell's cracked. <br>
BAREIL: How long have you known? <br>
KIRA: Since we left Ops. <br>
BAREIL: Then why did you come with me? <br>
KIRA: I needed the exercise. <br>
BAREIL: And I have to get away. <br>
(He raises the weapon to hit her, and she tosses him over her shoulder
onto the floor. The airlock door opens.) <br>
ODO: Are you all right, Major? <br>
KIRA: I'm fine. <br>
ODO: The resemblance to Vedek Bareil is remarkable.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAREIL: This is the cleanest interrogation chamber
I've ever been in, and believe me, I've been in quite a few. <br>
KIRA: I'm glad you're comfortable. Now, you mind telling me where you
got hold of this? <br>
BAREIL: A Terran rebel gave it to me. <br>
KIRA: A multidimensional transporter device. Nice gift. <br>
BAREIL: We were very close. So, when do I get to meet myself? <br>
KIRA: Meaning what? <br>
BAREIL: Well, this is the alternate universe, correct? Everything's the
same but different. Which means there's another Bareil Antos here. <br>
KIRA: There was. <br>
BAREIL: Was? <br>
KIRA: He's dead. <br>
BAREIL: You knew him, didn't you? Then that's why you seemed to
recognise me. What was he like? <br>
KIRA: Does that matter? <br>
BAREIL: He was someone you cared about. Major, I know I have no right
to ask this but you could do me a big favour. Destroy that device. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
BAREIL: Because then they can't send me back. <br>
KIRA: Sorry, I can't do that. <br>
BAREIL: Please, Major. You've been there. You know what it's like. Put
me in prison, in a labour camp, whatever you want. Just let me stay.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Now let me get this straight, Major. You're
refusing to press charges. <br>
KIRA: That's right. I don't think Bareil ever intended to hurt me. <br>
SISKO: I suppose we should just send him back where he came from. <br>
KIRA: No. He doesn't want to go back to that universe and I don't blame
him. <br>
SISKO: I know what you're going through, Major. When I met the other
Jennifer Sisko it was very confusing, to say the least. I knew she
wasn't my wife, but sometimes she would smile at me a certain way and
then the light would hit her eyes, and it was my Jennifer. At least,
that's what I wanted to believe. <br>
KIRA: Captain, I know this man is not Vedek Bareil. He doesn't talk
like him, he doesn't act like him. He's a totally different person. <br>
SISKO: But you still feel this connection with him that you can't
explain, don't you? <br>
KIRA: It's not a problem. <br>
SISKO: Good. Just make sure it doesn't become one.

Bajorans.) <br>
BAREIL: Major. I just wanted to say thank you for putting in a good
word for me. <br>
KIRA: What are you going to do now? <br>
BAREIL: I'm not sure. I've been reading up on your world, and it's very
different from the Bajor I know. <br>
KIRA: Is that where you intend to go? <br>
BAREIL: Well, I'm thinking about it. Did you see that? People keep
staring at me. <br>
KIRA: It's because the man that you look like was loved and respected
by a lot of people. He was a Vedek. <br>
BAREIL: A Vedek? <br>
KIRA: A religious leader. <br>
BAREIL: Imagine me a religious leader <br>
KIRA: Glad you find it funny. I'm going to be late for services. <br>
BAREIL: Wait. I didn't mean to offend you. It's just the kind of life
I've led hasn't been very spiritual. In fact, I don't think I've ever
been inside a temple. <br>
KIRA: Well, now's your chance. You're welcome to join me. <br>
BAREIL: In there? I don't think so. Besides, if I go in there, people
are going to start believing I really am Vedek Bareil. That's something
I'd like to avoid. <br>
KIRA: I can understand that.

KIRA: What are you doing here? <br>
BAREIL: I figured I could use a little spiritual guidance. <br>
KIRA: That's not funny. <br>
BAREIL: It wasn't meant to be. I plan on making a new life for myself
here. I'm going to need all the help I can get. <br>

this gift. <br>

OSSAN: Veshanoo yavar ha iktasho. <br>
BAREIL: What's in the box? <br>
KIRA: The Orb of Prophecy and Change. <br>
BAREIL: Orb? <br>
KIRA: A gift from the Prophets. It can foresee the future, or a
possible future anyway. <br>
BAREIL: Who are the Prophets? <br>
KIRA: Our gods. You do have gods, don't you? <br>
BAREIL: Of course we do. <br>
KIRA: You don't sound too sure. <br>

BAREIL: I'm not sure. It was an interesting ceremony, but <br>
KIRA: But what? <br>
BAREIL: Everyone seemed to take it so seriously. <br>
KIRA: What's wrong with that? <br>
BAREIL: I suppose it must be nice to have that kind of faith. I've
always preferred to believe in nothing. That way I'm never
disappointed. <br>
KIRA: That doesn't sound like much of a life. <br>
BAREIL: Maybe not, but it's all mine. Anyway, I'm glad I had this
chance to see you again. It was very enlightening. Thank you, Major. <br>
KIRA: Bareil. Do you like Klingon food?

my cell. He puts down what's supposed to be my last meal, I slip his
mek'leth out of its scabbard and hide it in my shirt. That night, I
used the blade to deactivate the sensor alarm, my earring to open the
cell door. By the time they realised I was gone, I was halfway to the
Ventar system. <br>
DAX: That's one hell of a story. <br>
WORF: And that is all it is, a story. <br>
BAREIL: Excuse me? <br>
WORF: It was well told but there was no truth to any of it. <br>
BAREIL: Oh, you're sure of that? <br>
WORF: You want us to believe that you stole a mek'leth from a Klingon
warrior. <br>
DAX: Worf, it's not polite to accuse a guest of lying. <br>
BAREIL: No, it's all right. Obviously, I was exaggerating. <br>
DAX: Would you like to do the honours? <br>
(Dax brings a cake and hands Worf a knife to cut it with. Bareil
stands.) <br>
BAREIL: Allow me. <br>
(Bareil produces a mek'leth and cuts the cake into four even pieces.) <br>
BAREIL: I believe this is yours? <br>
KIRA: What do you think now, Worf? <br>

street in Ilvia. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She had the most
attractive little money sack hanging from her waist. <br>
KIRA: Don't tell me you stole it? <br>
BAREIL: She should've known better than to carry her money so
carelessly in Ilvia. It's a very dangerous place. Turns out she'd just
arrived from one of the mining camps in the hills of Dahkur Province. <br>
KIRA: I come from Dahkur Province, only here it's all farmland. <br>
BAREIL: When I met her she was working in an Ilvian pleasure centre. <br>
KIRA: And you decided to take her away from all that. <br>
BAREIL: I taught her how to be a thief. The funny thing is, she was so
grateful. She felt I saved her life. <br>
KIRA: Maybe you did. <br>
BAREIL: If anyone was saved it was me. We were having dinner in a bar
one night. A fight broke out. A drunken Cardassian pulled out a
disruptor and started firing. We were together five years, and in all
that time I never told her how much she meant to me. <br>
KIRA: I know what it's like to lose someone. <br>
BAREIL: When I activated that transporter device I had no idea where
I'd end up. I never thought I'd be sitting here with you. <br>

KIRA: I can't believe you're still hungry. After a big Klingon meal, I
usually don't eat for two days. <br>
BAREIL: Ever since I got here I can't stop eating. What is it? <br>
KIRA: Nothing. <br>
BAREIL: This must be very strange for you. You and I here together, me
looking like him. <br>
KIRA: Fortunately, you're not anything like him. <br>
BAREIL: You mean he didn't eat in bed? <br>
KIRA: Antos was very disciplined. He had a strict routine he never
deviated from. He only ate two meals a day. Simple food. He used to
say, when you overindulge the body <br>
BAREIL: You starve the soul. <br>
KIRA: How did you know that? <br>
BAREIL: I did a little research. Enough to know that when he died,
Bajor suffered a great loss. <br>
KIRA: I would've given my life to save his. But all I could do was
stand there and watch his slip away. <br>

INTENDANT: Today you're a thief, but tomorrow, once we bring our prize
home, you'll be Bearer of the Orb. The holy man who unites the Bajoran
people in a war against the Alliance. <br>
BAREIL: Just call me Vedek Bareil. <br>
INTENDANT: Think of it, the wealth, the power. You'll be like a god. <br>
BAREIL: You're putting a lot of faith in that Orb. <br>
INTENDANT: So will every other Bajoran. We're going to have such fun. I
can hardly wait. You do look tired. You should get some rest. And
tomorrow when you see the Major (kiss) give her that from me. Sleep
well.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAREIL: One more. <br>
QUARK: Coming right up. <br>
BAREIL: What are you two staring at? Same goes for the rest of you. I
am not Vedek Bareil. I just want to be left alone. <br>
QUARK: You heard the man. Now leave him be. Sorry about that. People
can be so rude. You know, I used to see the Vedek all the time, walking
down the Promenade with Major Kira. Never came in here, though. I guess
dabo wasn't his game. It's an amazing resemblance. Put you in a Vedek's
robe and nobody would know the difference. <br>
BAREIL: Believe me, there's a difference. <br>
QUARK: But not to the paying public. <br>
BAREIL: You have a business proposition for me? Spit it out. <br>
QUARK: Picture this. You seated here wearing robes. A long line of
Bajorans waiting patiently to pay good money just to meet Vedek Bareil,
maybe touch his hand. <br>
BAREIL: Like I said, I'm not Vedek Bareil. <br>
QUARK: A mere technicality. You're the closest thing to Vedek Bareil
they're ever going to see. Which is why they're going to love you. <br>
BAREIL: I wouldn't know what to say. <br>
QUARK: The less, the better. Just nod every once in a while and smile
benignly. It's very simple. Later on, once you get the hang of it, you
might even throw in a blessing or two. What do you think? <br>
BAREIL: I've known people like you my whole life. Nasty, greedy little
minds willing to do whatever it takes to make money. I know just how
you think. <br>
QUARK: That's because you think the same way. <br>
BAREIL: I suppose I am a lot more like you than I'll ever be like Vedek
Bareil. <br>
QUARK: Perfect. Then we have a deal? <br>
BAREIL: I'm afraid not. <br>
QUARK: Why? <br>
BAREIL: Because right now I don't like either one of us. <br>
(Bareil leaves.) <br>
QUARK: It's a shame to see such a perfect opportunity go to waste.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Major, any idea where they put my shipment
of Saurian brandy? <br>
KIRA: Over there. <br>
QUARK: (to waiters) You heard her. Your new boyfriend came into my bar
today. <br>
KIRA: Did he? <br>
QUARK: He's a little different, isn't he. <br>
KIRA: From what? <br>
QUARK: From some of your previous choices. Don't get me wrong, I had
nothing against Vedek Bareil or Shakaar, but they were a little too
controlled, a little too controlling. They lacked fire, excitement. But
this Bareil? He's different. He's full of surprises. <br>
KIRA: So I take it that you like him. <br>
QUARK: Let's just say I like the idea of you with him. But let me tell
you something, Major. You'd better brace yourself. You're in for a
rough ride. <br>
KIRA: What are you talking about? <br>
QUARK: I've been a bartender for a long time. I've seen all sorts of
customers. Sad ones, happy ones, complicated ones. <br>
KIRA: And Bareil, where does he fit in? <br>
QUARK: He's one of the tormented ones. <br>
KIRA: Tormented? No, I don't think so. Quark, you've had an Orb
experience. You know what it's like. <br>
QUARK: He had an Orb experience? Interesting. <br>
KIRA: Meaning what? <br>
QUARK: After he left the bar, I saw him hanging around the Bajoran
Shrine. He must've been there a couple of hours. <br>
KIRA: He has a lot on his mind. He probably went there to think things
over. <br>
QUARK: Either that or he was figuring out a way to rob the place.
What's this, a union meeting? Let's get going. Nice chatting with you,
Major. I hope you two are very happy together.

INTENDANT: Well, what do you think? <br>
BAREIL: Even I'd have trouble telling you apart. <br>
INTENDANT: Wearing the Major's clothes, it feels so intimate. Oh, admit
it. You've never found me more exciting. It's like having the best of
both worlds. <br>
BAREIL: Let's try to stay focused, all right? We both have jobs to do. <br>
INTENDANT: You're right, we'll celebrate later. Did you get the comm.
badges? Oh what nimble fingers. Contact me the minute you have the Orb.
<br>
BAREIL: Right. <br>

INTENDANT: Of course. <br>
(She clutches her shoulder.) <br>
SECURITY: Is everything all right? <br>
INTENDANT: I must have pulled a muscle exercising in the holosuites.
It's been bothering me all day. Would you mind massaging my shoulders
for me? I could make it an order. <br>
(So he obeys) <br>
INTENDANT: A little harder, please. Oh, such strong hands. If only we
had some warm Somata oil. That would be nice, wouldn't it? <br>

KIRA: The question is, what are you doing here? <br>
BAREIL: Nerys. How did you know? <br>
KIRA: I didn't. You had me completely fooled. The thief in search of
redemption, who could resist that? Obviously not me. Luckily, Quark
didn't fall for your little act. Now step away from the altar. <br>
BAREIL: I wish I could, but I can't. I've come too far. <br>
KIRA: Then you came a long way for nothing. <br>
INTENDANT: Nerys! Oh, you look as beautiful as ever. <br>
(Bareil takes Kira's weapon.) <br>
KIRA: You're just full of surprises, aren't you? <br>
INTENDANT: It's only fair. You had your Bareil, I have mine. <br>
BAREIL: You're suppose to wait for me at the transporter pad. <br>
INTENDANT: Don't worry, I have the transporter keyed to this control.
All I have to do is tap this key and we're on our way home. Besides, I
couldn't leave without saying hello to myself. The transporter sensors
showed that you weren't alone in the shrine and I was hoping it was
you, Nerys. Bareil's smart but you're smarter. We really are alike,
aren't we? <br>
KIRA: You can't let her have the Orb. It's too dangerous. <br>
INTENDANT: Will you stop wasting your breath. Antos and I are a team.
We're destined to do great things together. <br>
BAREIL: If we're going, let's go. <br>
KIRA: You don't have to do this. <br>
INTENDANT: Isn't that sweet? She is still trying to save your soul. Of
course, you don't have one. <br>
BAREIL: She's right. I'm not worth saving. <br>
KIRA: You sound pretty certain of that. <br>
INTENDANT: Look at him. Really, look at him. It's important that you
see him for what he truly is. <br>
KIRA: I do. So you were just using me to get to the Orb? Is that what
I'm supposed to believe? <br>
BAREIL: Believe anything you want. <br>
INTENDANT: Please, Nerys, don't embarrass yourself. You made a mistake.
You let Bareil make a fool of you. That's bad enough. Don't make it
worse by denying what happened. Just accept it and move on. <br>
KIRA: Why should I? It's not true. You know that as well as I do. You
may have come here for the Orb, but you found something else. <br>
INTENDANT: And people say that I have a large ego. Tell her, Antos.
Tell her how you were using her, that everything you told her was a
lie. That every time you touched her all you could think about was me. <br>
(Bareil shoots the Intendant.) <br>
BAREIL: When she wakes up, I'll have a lot of explaining to do. <br>
KIRA: And if you don't have the Orb, she'll kill you. <br>
BAREIL: Maybe. That will certainly be her first reaction, but I've
talked my way back into her good graces before. I'll be all right. <br>
KIRA: I guess this is goodbye. <br>
BAREIL: It's for the best. You know what I saw when I looked into that
Orb? You and me, together on Bajor. We had a life, a family. <br>
KIRA: What's wrong with that? <br>
BAREIL: Nothing. It might even work, for a while. But eventually I'd
find some way to ruin it. I'm a thief. I belong with her. <br>
KIRA: Then you should go. <br>
