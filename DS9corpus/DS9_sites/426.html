log, stardate 47229.1. Chief O'Brien and I have been working overtime
to prepare for the arrival of a new cartographer. Ensign Melora Pazlar
is the first Elaysian to join Starfleet and, as such, requires special
accommodations.

DAX: I haven't seen one of these in three hundred years. I'm surprised
it was even on file in the replicator's data bank. <br>
BASHIR: It isn't. Ensign Pazlar sent me the specifications. <br>
DAX: She really uses one like this? <br>
BASHIR: Her normal anti-grav unit isn't going to work here. Same
problem we had with the Starfleet cargo lifts. Cardassian construction
just isn't compatible. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Ops to Bashir. The Yellowstone has just docked at airlock
fourteen, Doctor. <br>

here, Jadzia. What it must be like to adjust to our gravity after
growing up on a planet with such low surface gravity. <br>
O'BRIEN: Doctor. We've done the best we can with the ramps. The
Cardassians obviously didn't have her in mind when they built this
place. <br>
BASHIR: I've managed to modify the maximum vertical clearance of the
chair three centimetres to a slope of fifty six degrees. <br>
O'BRIEN: That still leaves a lot of places around here she won't have
access to. <br>
DAX: Can't we just use the transporter to help her get around? <br>
O'BRIEN: It makes sense to me, but she sent word that it wasn't be
acceptable to her. <br>
DAX: I wonder why. <br>
BASHIR: I know exactly why. She went through the Academy the same way.
Once her basic needs are met, she refuses any special assistance. She's
extraordinary. <br>
DAX: You make it sound as though you've known her for years. <br>
BASHIR: I almost feel as though I have. I've pulled all her personnel
and medical files to get ready. Her quarters. They're ready, aren't
they? <br>
O'BRIEN: I've got the bumps on the head to prove it. <br>
BASHIR: Thanks, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let me know if there's anything else I can do. <br>
BASHIR: That'll be something to see. When we turn off the gravity and
she flies around the room.

DAX: Can I help? <br>
MELORA: I'm fine, thank you. <br>

MELORA: That's better. You've modified it. <br>
BASHIR: Yes. I wanted to give you as much mobility as I could. <br>
MELORA: I've been practicing on the model I requested for a month. <br>
BASHIR: Well, it's no problem. We can replicate the other design. <br>
MELORA: No, I'll just have to adapt.

mission. <br>
MELORA: I really don't think that'll be necessary, Lieutenant. I'm
perfectly capable of piloting a runabout. <br>
DAX: Commander Sisko thought that it <br>
MELORA: I'm sure he thought what every officer I've ever served with
has thought. That I need extra help to get the job done. Please tell
him I don't. <br>
DAX: Commander Sisko wouldn't allow any Ensign take a runabout into the
Gamma Quadrant the day after she arrives. <br>
MELORA: I'm sure the Chief Science Officer has more important things to
do than to chart a sector in the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
BASHIR: Um. Here we are. <br>
MELORA: You didn't modified the specifications I gave you for my
quarters, did you? <br>
BASHIR: Not one iota. You can control the gravity unit with this
device. If you'd care to try it out. <br>
MELORA: Thank you, I will. It was a pleasure meeting both of you. <br>

Rings of Paltriss to his birthplace. <br>
QUARK: Honour my name all you want as long as your honour is
accompanied by a hundred and ninety nine bars of gold-pressed latinum <br>

QUARK: Fallit Kot, is it really you? How long has it been? <br>
FALLIT: Eight years. Eight long years. <br>
QUARK: It can't be. I must say, you look terrific. Tanned, toned up,
all of that baby fat has disappeared from your face. <br>
FALLIT: You don't keep extra weight on where I've been. <br>
QUARK: Just passing through, are you? I'll bet you have business in the
Gamma Quadrant. You always had a sharp eye for fresh territories. <br>
FALLIT: I'm not going to the Gamma Quadrant. My business is right here.

MELORA: Wouldn't it have been more appropriate to include me in that

discuss personnel matters all the time. <br></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MELORA: I'm sorry if I seem overly sensitive, but
I'm used to being shut out of the Melora problem. The truth is, there
is no Melora problem until people create one.
This may sound ungrateful, because Doctor Bashir has been wonderfully
helpful in the preparations for my arrival, but frankly, I wonder why a
medical opinion is necessary in this discussion. <br>
DAX: Julian knows more of your capabilities than any of us. <br>
MELORA: I don't need a medical opinion to tell me my own capabilities. <br>
SISKO: Ensign. <br>
MELORA: I simply object to being treated like someone who is ill. <br>
SISKO: I don't see anybody doing that. <br>
MELORA: Try sitting in the chair, Commander. No one can understand
until they sit in the chair. I have been in one chair or another since
I left my homeworld. My family gave me this cane. It's made from the
wood of a garlanic tree. They had no idea what it would be like to live
off-world in what you consider normal gravity. Only a handful of
Elaysians have ever left home. But I always knew that I had to be one
of them. I dreamt about exploring the stars as a child, and I wasn't
going to allow any handicap, not a chair, not a Cardassian station, to
stop me from chasing that dream. <br>
SISKO: You must feel a great deal of pride about you've achieved. <br>
MELORA: And I've achieved that, Commander, without being dependent on
anybody. To be honest, I prefer to work alone. It's simply easier for
me. <br>
SISKO: I am not comfortable sending you alone into the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
MELORA: Sir, I can focus on the job better, I can work at my own pace
without being a bother to anyone else. <br>
SISKO: Lieutenant Dax will be going with you. <br>
MELORA: Yes, sir. When do you wish to leave, Lieutenant? <br>

(A picture of Melora and a male flying) <br>
MELORA: Doctor, if you came for an apology, Doctor, I apologise. <br>
BASHIR: Apology? <br>
MELORA: My speech wasn't intended to attack you personally. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure you never set out to attack anyone personally, but you
do seem to attack a lot. <br>
MELORA: That's rather insensitive of you, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Julian. I'm no longer your doctor. <br>

MELORA: I really don't mean to <br>
BASHIR: Sure you do. <br>
MELORA: I beg your pardon? <br>
BASHIR: Of course, you mean to. All of these broad shots you fire it's
your way of keeping the rest of the universe on the defensive. Has to
be. You're too good at it. <br>
MELORA: Well, it always seemed to work pretty well. Until now. <br>

QUARK: Why spoil your appetite with soup? Here's the real treat. Jumbo
Vulcan mollusks.
SautÃ©ed in rhombolian butter. A taste so exquisite, it's to die for. Or
to live for, for that matter. <br>

BASHIR: When I was ten, my father was a Federation diplomat on Invernia
Two. One day, when we were out on a remote part of the planet, we were
hit by a massive ionic storm. While we were waiting it out, we found an
Invernian girl about my age who was sick. After the storm cleared, my
father went for help, but it was too late. I sat there and watched her
die. The next day when he returned, his guide told us that we could
have treated her with a simple herb that was growing all around. I
could have saved her life. <br>
MELORA: And so you started to study medicine. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, first I started to study tennis. <br>
MELORA: Tennis? <br>
BASHIR: I really thought about making a career of it. <br>
MELORA: You must be very good. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I used to think so, but then I went to my first major
competition. my opponent served first and I heard the ball bounce past
me. The computer announced it was good and I realised I was in trouble.
Turned out I had more talent at medicine than tennis. <br>

BASHIR: I'd like to think that has more to do with me than the
neo-analeptic infusion. <br>
MELORA: Would that also explain why my backside is getting warm. <br>
BASHIR: That's more likely the result of the neuromuscular tissue
stimulation due to increased activity in the motor cortex. I'd say
that's enough first time out. It's good that you've already been using
your muscles in this gravity environment. It'll make it easier to
adapt. Feel any different? <br>
MELORA: No. <br>

above normal. Increased tensile strength would be the inevitable
result. <br>

MELORA: I wanted to give you our first day's mission summary myself,

SISKO: A pleasure, Ensign. <br>
DAX: Julian, how did you? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, it was simply a matter of increasing the output on the

the i's and crossed the t's. <br>

yourself at home. <br>

QUARK: What's mine is yours. All you have to do is ask. <br>

BASHIR: Melora, if you're not certain? <br>
MELORA: Oh, I'm sure it's just some strange form of buyers remorse.
I'll be fine. <br>
BASHIR: Tell me exactly what you're feeling. <br>
MELORA: Last night, I just missed. I didn't feel like me. <br>
BASHIR: If you want to end your dependence on the chair and the servo
controls, you're going to have to give up the low-grav environment. You
knew that that was the trade-off. <br>
MELORA: And it seemed like a good trade, until I realised I couldn't do
it anymore. If I could just spend <br>
BASHIR: I'm just concerned that going back and forth could ultimately
lead to a loss of fine motor control. <br>
MELORA: Meaning? <br>
BASHIR: Your ability to perform complex tasks could be affected. The
effects are fully reversible for the next few days. We can pull the
plug at any time before then. But after that, if all goes well, your
motor cortex impulses will kick in on their own. Permanently.
