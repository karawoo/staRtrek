you start to have trouble with Quark? <br>
SARDA: About five minutes after I got off the ship. <br>
SISKO: He immediately made sexual advances? <br>
SARDA: He said it was part of the job. <br>
SISKO: And what did you say? <br>
SARDA: I told him I'd wear the costume and entertain the gamblers, but
to keep his Ferengi knuckles to himself. <br>
SISKO: That didn't stop him? <br>
SARDA: No. He said again that it was part of the job. He showed me my
employment agreement. See? There it is in the Ferengi print. Page
twenty one, subsection D, paragraph twelve. <br>

TOSK [on viewscreen]: Alpha Quadrant? <br>
SISKO: You've passed through a wormhole into a new part of the galaxy. <br>
TOSK [on viewscreen]: I saw a small ship disappear. I followed it <br>
SISKO: That was one of our patrol vessels. You've travelled almost
ninety thousand light years. What planet do you come from? <br>

you're welcome to dock here and we'll try to answer all your questions.

O'BRIEN: Cut your engines. <br>
TOSK [on viewscreen]: Why? <br>
O'BRIEN: So I can save your ship, friend. We'll bring you in. Try to
fix you up as good as new. Good. Engaging tractor beam. Steady now.
Feel the graviton field taking hold? <br>
TOSK [on viewscreen]: Yes. <br>
O'BRIEN: You'll be fine now. Just relax and enjoy the ride. <br>

DAX: I think we might want to skip formal first contact procedures for
now. <br>
SISKO: Agreed. Why don't you meet him by yourself at the airlock,
Mister O'Brien. He might find that a little less intimidating. <br>

I'm just going to take a look at your ship. See what the problem is.
Okay? Just to let you know, I'm an engineer. I know a little bit about
ships. Well, more than a little, actually, but I'll tell you, I've
never seen anything close to this. All right then. Is this some sort of
plasma injector? Okay. Then <br>

O'BRIEN: that must be an off-axis field controller over there. <br>
TOSK: The coladrium flow has been damaged. <br>
(O'Brien bumps his head) <br>
O'BRIEN: You can't go sneaking up on someone like that, friend. It's an
Alpha quadrant rule. <br>
TOSK: Can it be repaired? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, that all depends.<br>
TOSK: Depends? <br>
O'BRIEN: On what exactly a coladrium flow is. <br>
TOSK: On my world, it would be simple. With proper materials I could do
it myself. <br>
O'BRIEN: Hang on, I didn't say we couldn't figure it out. You're just
going to have to teach me as we go. I'm sure that we can <br>

phaser. You're fine. <br>
TOSK: You wear a weapon? <br>
O'BRIEN: Defensive purposes only. It may not seem hospitable, but when
you go into an alien ship for the first time, you never know what might
be in there. You may even find someone who can make himself invisible,
you know what I mean? <br>
TOSK: I understand. A health centre? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah. That's Doctor Bashir. He looks after our medical
problems. <br>
TOSK: How many live here? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, three hundred, more or less. <br>
TOSK: What is its purpose? <br>
O'BRIEN: Purpose? <br>
TOSK: Defence? Surveillance? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, sometimes when I walk along here I feel like we're the
flea markets of the sector. But I guess our real job is to keep an eye
on the wormhole. There's traffic going in and out all the time now. <br>
TOSK: Many ships dock here? <br>
O'BRIEN: Five or six a week. We sometimes have a whole convoy on its
way through the wormhole. But you have the honour of being the first
visitor from the other side. <br>
TOSK: Others will detect ships from your quadrant as I did and follow
them here. <br>
O'BRIEN: We hope so. Our mission as Starfleet officers is to seek out
new life forms so we can learn about each other. <br>
QUARK: Madame, I distinctly saw you move your wager to the green line
after the play was completed. I will return your currency, but you will
promptly leave the establishment. You are not welcome here. <br>

get some rest? <br>
TOSK: I require only seventeen minutes of sleep per rotation. <br>
O'BRIEN: Seventeen? No kidding. If I don't get a good eight hours a
night, I'm not the same man. Are you hungry? <br>
TOSK: Hungry? <br>
O'BRIEN: You know, would you like to eat, take in sustenance? <br>
TOSK: Liquid nutrients are stored in plasmic fibres throughout my body.

O'BRIEN: Well, this is the food replicator over here in case you change
your mind. We've finally got it making a pretty good bowl of oatmeal.

shoulder is waiting for trouble to find him. <br>
SISKO: You think he's on the run? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll tell you this. He wasn't telling the whole truth about
the damage to his ship. It sure wasn't caused by the wormhole. Somebody
took a shot at him. It came in at a forty five degree angle to the
hull, sliced through two propulsion systems. I'll know more when I get
a better look at it. <br>
SISKO: Stay with him as much as possible while he's here. I'll tell Odo
to keep an eye on him too. <br>

O'BRIEN: What are they? Some kind of high-energy magnetic coils? <br>

O'BRIEN: Like a ramscoop. <br>
TOSK: Ramscoop? <br>
O'BRIEN: To capture stellar gases and convert them into usable fuel <br>
TOSK: Yes! The arva nodes convert space matter into fuel. <br>
O'BRIEN: Ah, got you. Piece of cake. <br>
TOSK: Piece of cake. Ramscoop. Arva nodes. <br>
O'BRIEN: A piece of cake. It's an old human expression. It means
they'll be easy to fix. <br>
TOSK: They will be easy to fix? <br>

we'll take them over to the replicator centre and make new ones. <br>

breaks down, you blame me, next thing I know my work has a bad
reputation in the Gamma quadrant. <br>

take him at his word. <br>

you could talk him into having a routine medical examination, maybe I
could <br>
O'BRIEN: The thing is, I kind of like the guy. I'm not even sure why.
In a way, he's almost naive. I guess any one would be in an alien
environment, but I don't sense a thread of criminal intent or
dishonesty about him. <br>

Tosk can know. To be captured and brought home alive. You will live out
your existence on public display where children can make fun of you,
toss you scraps of food which is more than you deserve. Release him. <br>
SISKO: You've disrupted life on this station for the pleasure of your
hunt? I'm not inclined to take orders from you. Odo, watch the prisoner
while our guest and I discuss this in private. Unless you intend to
take him by force, in which case I am prepared to give orders to open
fire on your ship. <br>
HUNTER: Over this Tosk?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HUNTER: Have you nothing similar in your own
society? <br>
SISKO: Centuries ago, people on my world engaged in bloodsports,
killing lower species for pleasure. A few cultures still do. But even
they wouldn't consider hunting a sentient being. <br>
HUNTER: But he is sentient only because we have made him sentient. He
has been bred for the hunt. His entire reason to exist is the hunt. To
make it as exciting, as interesting, as he can. Obviously, you do not
comprehend. <br>
SISKO: I comprehend just fine. I have no tolerance for the abuse of any
lifeform. <br>
HUNTER: Abuse? We honour Tosk. They are the symbol of all that is noble
and courageous. They train and condition themselves all their lives for
this event. They're proud of their role in our culture. <br>
SISKO: I can't judge what is right and wrong for your world. But on
this station <br>
HUNTER: In the future, passage through the anomaly will be considered
out of bounds for the hunt. Will that satisfy you? Now you will arrange
for the release of the Tosk. <br>
(Hunter beams out)

O'BRIEN: But sir, Tosk is an intelligent, living being. <br>
SISKO: It's their custom, Chief. Under the prime directive, we have no
right to interfere. <br>
KIRA: What if Tosk were to request asylum? <br>

TOSK: A way out? Of here? <br>
O'BRIEN: Request asylum. <br>
TOSK: Asylum? <br>
O'BRIEN: You ask for the protection of the Federation. You understand?
My Commander is willing to protect you. <br>
TOSK: O'Brien, I am Tosk. I cannot hide here behind the protection of
your Federation. It is against everything I believe. <br>
O'BRIEN: You'd rather go back and live in a cage on public display? <br>
TOSK: To stay would be a greater dishonour. I am Tosk, the hunted. I
live to outwit the hunters for another day. To survive until I die with
honour. But that will not be my fate. But I will not deny my existence
as Tosk. Thank you, O'Brien, but I cannot request asylum.

trade from the Gamma Quadrant. Not one of them has bought a single
drink. <br>
O'BRIEN: Shut up, Quark. <br>
QUARK: More trouble with the little woman? <br>
O'BRIEN: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
QUARK: Nothing. Nothing. I just thought you might want to talk. <br>
O'BRIEN: There is nothing wrong between my wife and I. If there were, I
sure as hell wouldn't want to talk to some barkeep about it. <br>
QUARK: Sorry. My mistake. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
QUARK: Your face gets very pink when it gets aggravated. Much more so
than most other humans. <br>
O'BRIEN: So stop aggravating me. <br>
QUARK: Not me. You came in the door this way. <br>
O'BRIEN: Fine. You're right. I'm aggravated. <br>
QUARK: I am a keen observer of behaviour. You want to talk about it? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. <br>
QUARK: Why not? <br>
O'BRIEN: Because it wouldn't do any good talking to you. <br>
QUARK: Try me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Forget it. It's just the rules of the game. <br>
QUARK: Ah-ha. Rules of the game. Go on. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a hunt, did you know that? They're chasing Tosk in a
hunt. Everybody's playing by the rules. They're playing by their rules,
we're playing by ours and he's caught in the middle. Of course, I
suppose if the Ferengi don't like the rules, they just change them. <br>
QUARK: Well, rules, rules are always subject to interpretation. <br>
O'BRIEN: Of course! Change the rules. Why didn't I think of that?
Thanks, barkeep. <br>
QUARK: (to another customer) So, what's bothering you today?

O'BRIEN: No, sir, that won't be necessary. Good relations with other
cultures is our highest priority. Commander Sisko wants to make sure
you understand we're sorry we interfered with your hunt. The least we
can do is give you an official escort off the station. It's a token of
goodwill and respect in our society. <br>

two hundred percent. <br>

lifeforms to come through the wormhole. How do you suggest I write up
this report? <br>

weren't any happier than we were about having to bring Tosk home. It
seems to me in the interests of mutual understanding and future
relations <br>
SISKO: Save it. You ignored your duty to Starfleet. You took off your
comm. badge so you could ignore me. You even ignored the Prime
Directive by interfering with their damned hunt. Another stunt like
this and your wife won't have to complain about the conditions here
anymore. Do I make myself clear? <br>

SISKO: What's that? <br>
O'BRIEN: I knew I couldn't override all the security seals on the
station, and I figured once you and the Constable located us, well,
it'd be over. We'd find ourselves locked behind some forcefield
