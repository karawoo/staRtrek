time on Deep Space Nine.</i> <br><br>(KaBOOM goes the Bok'Nor.) <br>
SISKO: A number of Admirals at Starfleet Command are worried the
destruction of the Bok'Nor might jeopardise the treaty. <br>
HUDSON: Oh, are they really? <br>
SISKO: As the two ranking officers along the Cardassian border, we've
been asked to assess the potential risk. <br>
SAKONNA: I wish to procure weapons. <br>
QUARK: I beg your pardon? <br>
SAKONNA: Guns, phaser banks, photon torpedoes <br>
QUARK: Shh! <br>
SAKONNA: (sotto) Troop transports and a number of cobalt-thorium
devices. <br>
QUARK: You're a gun runner? <br>
DUKAT: I'm here unofficially to help you find out the truth about the
Bok'Nor. <br>
SISKO: Why would you want to help me? <br>
DUKAT: Because I already know the truth. <br>
SISKO: I've got people out there killing people, Major. You suggest I
turn a blind eye to that? <br>
KIRA: Well, they don't have a right to defend themselves? <br>
SISKO: They've crossed the line. <br>
KIRA: If Starfleet is unwilling to defend their people in <br>
SISKO: They chose to live with the Cardassians. <br>
KIRA: Well, I didn't. But I lived with them for twenty six years before
the liberation came. Every Bajoran lived with them in constant fear. I
know what those colonists are going through. <br>
(Dukat gets shot trying to escape from his kidnappers.) <br>
KIRA: We just received a general subspace transmission from somewhere
in the Demilitarised zone. A group there is taking credit for the
kidnapping of Dukat. They're calling themselves the Maquis. <br>
HUDSON: I'm glad to see you had no trouble finding us, Ben. It seems
that one disaster after another keeps bringing us back together again. <br><i><br>And now for the conclusion. </i> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Jungle]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HUDSON: You should have seen the look on your face
when you saw me standing there, Ben. <br>
SISKO: I hardly recognised you without your uniform. <br>
HUDSON: Well, it's been feeling a little tight lately. <br>
SISKO: Just like that. <br>
HUDSON: It's just a uniform, Ben. <br>
SISKO: Is that all it is? I remember when you first put it on. <br>
HUDSON: Yes, graduation day at the Academy. We both swore we'd be
starship captains by the time we were thirty. <br>
SISKO: And admirals by forty. <br>
HUDSON: Yes. <br>
SISKO: I think we've both done pretty well for ourselves. <br>
HUDSON: Yes, we have, haven't we? But now I've got something better.
These settlers, Ben, if you saw all they have accomplished without any
help from the Federation, then you'd fight along with them. <br>
SISKO: I don't think so. <br>
HUDSON: They've travelled out here to the back of the beyond and built
homes out of the wilderness. Now maybe the Federation can turn their
back on them, but I can't. <br>
SISKO: I'm not asking you to, but your joining the Maquis isn't helping
anyone. Your actions have only endangered the treaty and put millions
of lives at risk.<br>
HUDSON: The Federation believes that it can solve every problem with a
treaty, but out here, on the frontier, without the power of the
Federation to back them up, a treaty is only a piece of paper. <br>
SISKO: Do you have evidence that the Central Command has violated the
treaty? <br>
HUDSON: Not yet, but we will. <br>
SISKO: If you're depending on Gul Dukat for proof, you're going to be
disappointed. <br>
HUDSON: We'll find out, won't we. <br>
SISKO: I want him back, Cal. <br>
HUDSON: He's not here. <br>
SISKO: Then where is he? <br>
HUDSON: I never thought I'd see the day when you'd side with a
Cardassian against me. <br>
SISKO: Damn it, Cal. I'm on your side. <br>
HUDSON: You've got a funny way of showing it, Ben. <br>
SISKO: I'm trying to stop you from making one of the biggest mistakes
of your life. The Federation believes in the treaty. If you destroy it,
Starfleet will come after you and they won't be satisfied until you're
behind bars. If we work together to end the violence <br>
HUDSON: The violence will never end as long as the Central Command
continues to smuggle weapons to their colonies. I wish there were a
better way to handle this thing. I really do. Nobody wants peace any
more than the Maquis. <br>
SISKO: And you're willing to blow up Cardassian ships to get it. <br>
HUDSON: The Bok'Nor will never smuggle weapons again. <br>
SISKO: And its crewmembers won't be returning home to their families
either. Look, you say that the Central Command is behind the smuggling.
Fine. Let's prove it. <br>
HUDSON: How? <br>
SISKO: We'll go to Cardassia, find the evidence you need to back up
your claim, and when we do, we'll take it to the Federation <br>
HUDSON: No. The Federation abandoned us. Told us to take care of
ourselves. Well, that's what we intend to do, Ben. But you, you could
be invaluable to us. Let us use your station. <br>
SISKO: For what? <br>
HUDSON: A maintenance facility for our ships. <br>
SISKO: I can't allow that. <br>
HUDSON: Every week innocent people are being murdered by the
Cardassians. I will not allow those deaths to go unpunished. <br>
SISKO: You don't want peace, Cal. You want revenge. <br>
HUDSON: I prefer to call it retaliation. I'm sorry we won't be working
together, Benjamin. It would've been nice. Like old times. <br>
KIRA: Commander! <br>
HUDSON: Sorry, Ben. <br>
(Hudson shoots Sisko, and the other Maquis shoot Kira and Bashir.) <br>
HUDSON: Okay, let's go. Knowing Ben's temper when he wakes up, we won't
want to be here. Come on. Let's move out.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Lieutenant, I want to speak with the
Cardassian Central Command. <br>
DAX: Then you're in luck. Legate Parn will be arriving within the hour.
<br>
SISKO: A Legate? I feel honoured. While I'm waiting, I'll talk with
Starfleet. <br>
DAX: Admiral Necheyev's already here.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Chief, The Maquis must have transferred
Dukat off their ship before they reached that asteroid. I want to know
where they've hid him. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can retrace their warp trail, see if they met up with any
other ships. <br>
SISKO: Do it.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Commander's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Admiral. <br>
NECHEYEV: Commander, the Cardassian Central Command has gone on
military alert in response to the kidnapping of Gul Dukat. <br>
SISKO: I'm not surprised. <br>
NECHEYEV: This Security Chief of yours, the shape-shifter. <br>
SISKO: Odo. <br>
NECHEYEV: Odo. Are you sure you wouldn't be better off with a Starfleet
officer heading your security team. <br>
SISKO: Admiral, I have complete faith in Odo's ability to do his job. <br>
NECHEYEV: If you say so, Commander. <br>
SISKO: I do. And as for Gul Dukat, I assure you we're taking all
possible steps to locate him. <br>
NECHEYEV: Good. Keep me informed of your progress. <br>
SISKO: I will. But Admiral, there's a bigger issue here than rescuing
Dukat. <br>
NECHEYEV: And what is that? <br>
SISKO: The Maquis. <br>
NECHEYEV: The Maquis are a bunch of irresponsible hotheads. <br>
SISKO: These hotheads are responsible for the bombing of the Bok'Nor. <br>
NECHEYEV: I'm aware of that, Commander. We never should've allowed
those colonists to remain on the Cardassian side of the Demilitarised
zone. <br>
SISKO: Well they're there, Admiral, and they're not leaving. <br>
NECHEYEV: What about Commander Hudson? He's lived with these people.
What's his analysis of the situation? <br>
SISKO: I'll have to ask him. <br>
NECHEYEV: You do that. And Commander, I want you to find the Maquis.
Talk to them. Remind them that they're citizens of the Federation. That
it is imperative that we preserve the treaty with the Cardassians. <br>
SISKO: A treaty the Cardassians may not be honouring. <br>
NECHEYEV: Are you questioning Federation policy, Commander? <br>
SISKO: All I know is that the situation in the Demilitarised zone is
deteriorating rapidly. <br>
NECHEYEV: Personally, I think you're overstating the problem. Establish
a dialogue with the Maquis. They're still Federation citizens. I'm sure
they'll listen to reason. Good luck, Commander. <br>
(Necheyev leaves and Kira comes up the stairs) <br>
SISKO: Establish a dialogue? What the hell does she think I've been
trying to do? <br>
KIRA: Commander? <br>
SISKO: Just because a group of people belongs to the Federation it does
not mean that they are saints. <br>
KIRA: Excuse me? <br>
SISKO: Do you know what the trouble is? <br>
KIRA: No. <br>
SISKO: The trouble is Earth. <br>
KIRA: Really? <br>
SISKO: On Earth there is no poverty, no crime, no war. You look out the
window of Starfleet headquarters and you see paradise. Well, it's easy
to be a saint in paradise, but the Maquis do not live in paradise. Out
there in the Demilitarised zone, all the problems haven't been solved
yet. Out there, there are no saints, just people. Angry, scared,
determined people who are going to do whatever it takes to survive
whether it meets with Federation approval or not. <br>
KIRA: Makes sense to me. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad someone understands. <br>
KIRA: Legate Parn's ship just put in at docking bay five. Maybe you'd
like to give the same speech to him. <br>
SISKO: I just might do that. <br>
ODO [OC]: Odo to Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead, Constable. <br>
ODO [OC]: I think you'd better get down to Security. I've caught one of
the Vulcan's accomplices.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: I assure you, I had no idea that Sakonna was
planning to kidnap Gul Dukat. <br>
ODO: Really? Then perhaps you could explain why the two of you were
spending so much time together. <br>
QUARK: Surely it's no crime keeping company with a beautiful female.
You ought to try it, Odo. It might improve your disposition. <br>
ODO: Do you expect us to believe that a Vulcan would be interested in
you for your lobes? <br>
QUARK: Vulcans are a species that appreciate good ears. Commander, this
is very embarrassing, having to discuss my personal life in such
surroundings. <br>
SISKO: Embarrassment is going to be the least of your problems unless
you tell me what kind of business arrangement you had with this woman. <br>
QUARK: All right. But first I want to make it clear that I was led
astray by Sakonna's feminine wiles. <br>
ODO: Save the excuses, Quark. Just tell us what you were up to. <br>
QUARK: Sakonna was in the market for certain items which I was able to
obtain. At a considerable discount, I might add. <br>
SISKO: What items? <br>
ODO: We're waiting. <br>
QUARK: Let's see. Where to begin? She wanted some deflector shields,
navigational arrays, maybe a couple of hundred photon torpedoes. <br>
SISKO: Photon torpedoes! <br>
QUARK: And pulse cannons and some high energy disrupters. <br>
ODO: Weapons. You sold weapons to a terrorist group. <br>
QUARK: I did not. The Pygorians sold them the weapons. I merely made
some introductions. Besides, I hadn't even heard of the Maquis until
after Dukat was kidnapped. <br>
SISKO: I want a complete list of every weapon she purchased. <br>
QUARK: Of course. And if you need some one to testify against Sakonna
in court, I'd be more than willing. <br>
ODO: Would you? <br>
QUARK: In a second. And let me know if there's anyone else who needs
testifying against. I'll tell you one thing, Commander, Sakonna was on
a tight clock. Whatever she needed those weapons for, it's going to
happen within the next few days. <br>
SISKO: Just get me the list. <br>
ODO: Sir? I assume you'll be going out to search for Dukat again? <br>
SISKO: As soon as O'Brien tells us where to look. <br>
ODO: As Chief of Security, I'd like to go along. <br>
SISKO: I'll be happy to have you along. <br>
ODO: One other thing. How long do I keep him in here? <br>
SISKO: Forever. <br>
(Sisko leaves) <br>
QUARK: Odo. <br>
(Odo leaves) <br>
QUARK: This isn't funny. Odo! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Promenade]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Commander, this is Legate Parn. He insisted
on seeing you immediately. <br>
PARN: Because my business here is crucial. It demands immediate
attention. And as a member of the Cardassian Central Command I must
assure you, Commander, that what we have to discuss is most crucial
indeed. <br>
SISKO: I understand. I assure you we are doing everything we can to
find Gul Dukat. <br>
PARN: Please, Commander, your efforts are appreciated but unnecessary.
You see, Central Command has learned that Gul Dukat was the leader of a
small group of misguided officers who were funnelling weapons to our
colonies in the Demilitarised zone. <br>
KIRA: The Maquis are right. The Cardassian settlers are being supplied
by the Central Command. <br>
PARN: Dukat and the others were operating entirely without our
knowledge. Central Command would never sanction anything that would
violate our treaty with the Federation. We've arrested Dukat's
co-conspirators and they shall be dealt with accordingly. <br>
SISKO: Where does that leave Dukat? <br>
PARN: With the Maquis, where he belongs. <br>
SISKO: Are you saying you don't want him back? <br>
PARN: I assume the Maquis will execute him for his crimes. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't be surprised. <br>
PARN: Well then, I don't see what difference it makes whether we do it
or they do it. <br>
KIRA: How do we know they won't use Dukat's death as an excuse to send
troops into the Demilitarised zone? <br>
PARN: I can assure you, Commander, that there shall be no retaliation.
The Cardassians have no desire to go to war again with the Federation.
You have my word. <br>
KIRA: Your word? <br>
SISKO: Major. I've found our little talk very enlightening. <br>
PARN: I hoped you would. <br>
SISKO: Unfortunately, I have some business to attend to, but I do hope
you'll take the time to enjoy the station. <br>
PARN: Thank you, Commander, but I too must attend to my business.
Besides, I am afraid this place has lost its charm since the last time
I was here. <br>
(Parn leaves through the airlock) <br>
KIRA: I don't believe a word he said. <br>
SISKO: Neither do I. But he did tell me something that I needed to
know. Cal was right. The Central Command is smuggling weapons into the
Demilitarised zone.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: We just received a report that three
Federation settlers were killed on Hakton Seven. The Cardassians claim
it was in response to the destruction of the Bok'Nor. <br>
SISKO: Which gives the Maquis a new excuse to strike back. Chief, what
have you found? <br>
O'BRIEN: Based on the residual subspace distortion of their warp drive,
I was able to plot the course of the Maquis ship that took Dukat. As
you can see, long range sensors show no signs of any other vessels
travelling along that route. <br>
SISKO: All right. They didn't transfer him to another ship. What about
a planet? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's possible. Their course took them past five M Class
planets. I've downloaded their coordinates into the Rio Grande's
computer. <br>
SISKO: Good work. Sisko to Odo. <br>
ODO [OC]: Yes, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Find Doctor Bashir and meet me immediately at landing pad C. <br>
ODO [OC]: On our way. <br>
KIRA: Commander, you know there's no reason to go after Dukat. I mean,
you heard Legate Parn. They don't want him back. <br>
SISKO: Are you suggesting we leave him to the Maquis? <br>
KIRA: Why risk our lives over someone who's caused so many deaths? The
way I see it, he's getting exactly what he deserves. <br>
(Sisko steps onto the turbolift.) <br>
SISKO: The Central Command wants him dead. That's reason enough for us
to want him alive. Landing pad C.

thoughts. My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. My mind
to your mind. <br>
AMAROS: What is wrong? <br>
DUKAT: It's not working. That is what's wrong. <br>
SAKONNA: This is quite puzzling. I am unable to establish a mind meld.
It would appear he has the ability to shield his thoughts. <br>
DUKAT: It's simply a matter of discipline. <br>
AMAROS: Now what do we do? <br>
SAKONNA: I will rest a while, and then I will try again. <br>
DUKAT: You people really do not do this very well, do you? Now, on
Cardassia we know how to extract information, though it can get a bit
unpleasant, and we all know how the Federation dislikes unpleasantness.
<br>
AMAROS: I share very few sentiments with the Federation. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, that's right. You're renegades, aren't you? Or so you'd like
to think. Unfortunately, the Federation has taught you your lessons all
too well. You simply lack the commitment it takes to do what is
necessary. <br>
AMAROS: You tell that to the crew of the Bok'Nor. <br>
DUKAT: Anyone can blow up a ship. Ha! But to look your enemy in the
eye, knowing you'll remember his face for the rest of your life. Now
that takes a stomach much stronger than you'll ever have. <br>
AMAROS: We'll see about that. <br>
SAKONNA: No. He's right. We do not possess the Cardassian gift for
inflicting pain. <br>
DUKAT: There, you see? <br>
SAKONNA: Nor would we want such a gift. <br>
AMAROS: But we do need to know when the Central Command is sending its
next weapons shipment. So if it's all the same to you, Sakonna, I'll
take over this interrogation. Then we can find out just how committed I
am. <br>
SISKO: I don't think anyone's that interested. Put down your weapons.
We're not here to fight you. <br>
AMAROS: If that is true, then you will let us go about our business. <br>
SISKO: I'm not leaving without Dukat. <br>
AMAROS: Then you're not leaving. <br>
BASHIR: Look, we're all on the same side here. We all want to stop the
arms shipments. Why not work together? <br>
DUKAT: Will you stop talking and shoot them. <br>
SISKO: No. That's not what we want. <br>
DUKAT: What are you waiting for? <br>
SISKO: Put down your weapons. <br>
ODO: Do as he says. <br>
DUKAT: Shoot them! <br>
(Dukat knocks down Sakonna, Amaros fires, others follow. Bashir stuns
one Maquis, Sisko two. Amaros tries to run up the ladder and Odo
literally lassoes him. Dukat grabs Amaros then Sisko gets to Dukat.) <br>
SISKO: Let him go. I said, let him go! Odo, get these people secured on
the runabout. <br>
ODO: With pleasure, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Except this one. <br>
AMAROS: You mean I'm free to go? <br>
SISKO: Tell Cal Hudson I haven't told Starfleet anything yet. Tell him
we can still solve this thing together, but we're running out of time.
Tell him I still have his uniform. He can have it back anytime he
wants.

DUKAT: I find a good meal extremely relaxing, especially after a
difficult day. <br>
SISKO: So do I. <br>
DUKAT: Really? I wonder what else we have in common. <br>
SISKO: Very little, I imagine. <br>
DUKAT: Other than the fact that you have my office. Tell me, what's
going to happen with your prisoners? <br>
SISKO: They'll be tried for their crimes under the Federation Code of
Justice. <br>
DUKAT: And if they're found innocent? <br>
SISKO: I doubt that they will, but if they are, they'll be set free. <br>
DUKAT: How barbaric. On Cardassia, the verdict is always known before
the trial begins. And it's always the same. <br>
SISKO: In that case, why bother with a trial at all? <br>
DUKAT: Because the people demand it. They enjoy watching justice
triumph over evil every time. They find it comforting. <br>
SISKO: Isn't there ever a chance you might try an innocent man by
mistake? <br>
DUKAT: Cardassians don't make mistakes. <br>
SISKO: I'll have to remember that. <br>
DUKAT: Commander, one thing does puzzle me. Surely the Central Command
was informed of my kidnapping. <br>
SISKO: They learned about it almost as soon as it happened. <br>
DUKAT: Then why was I rescued by you? Why wasn't the station surrounded
by Cardassian ships demanding my release? <br>
SISKO: We did receive a visit from Legate Parn. <br>
DUKAT: Ah. I'm sure he made some rather ugly threats on my behalf. <br>
SISKO: He said that you were the one responsible for smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarised zone, that if the Maquis did not execute you,
then the Central Command would. After a comforting trial, I'm sure. <br>
DUKAT: It seems my relationship with the Central Command has somewhat
deteriorated. I knew this was inevitable the moment we withdrew from
Bajor. <br>
SISKO: Are you saying they blame you for the withdrawal? <br>
DUKAT: Ha. There are those who believe I should have killed every last
Bajoran while I had the chance. Oh well, it's too late for that, I'm
afraid. Commander, it seems I was mistaken <br>
SISKO: Mistaken about the arms shipment? <br>
DUKAT: It appears I was misinformed. I'm beginning to believe the
Central Command is indeed smuggling weapons into the Demilitarised zone
after all. <br>
SISKO: Then you really didn't know, did you? <br>
DUKAT: No. They never bothered to tell me. If I help you stop the
smuggling, will you help me stop the Maquis? <br>
SISKO: You have a deal. I've scheduled a staff meeting for oh nine
hundred. <br>
DUKAT: I'll be there. Commander, thank you for coming to my rescue. <br>

ODO: I do, and quite a list it is. Six ship-mounted high energy
disrupters, three particle accelerators, two hundred photon torpedoes

KIRA: With that kind of firepower, the Bajorans could've launched a
full-scale assault on Cardassia. <br>
DUKAT: And lost. <br>

skirmishes. They're ready for something bigger. <br>

DAX: Have you been able to make any headway with Sakonna? <br>
ODO: Have you ever tried to interrogate a Vulcan, Lieutenant? <br>
DAX: No. <br>

DUKAT: Because the Xepolites have often served as intermediaries for us
in the past. <br>
SISKO: So have the Lissepians. <br>
DUKAT: Ah, but the Xepolites have never been caught.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: The Xepolite ship isn't responding to our
hail, sir. <br>
DUKAT: Of course they're not responding. Would you respond to a
Federation hail if your cargo bays were full of Cardassian weapons? <br>
SISKO: Scan their ship, Major. Let's see what they're carrying. <br>
KIRA: Our scanners can't penetrate their hull. <br>
O'BRIEN: No wonder. It's composed of a sensor reflective material. They
obviously value their privacy. <br>
SISKO: Chief, you and Gul Dukat remain here. Major, you're with me.
Let's go see if it's their privacy or their guilt they're trying to
protect. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sorry, Commander, you can't transport over. They just raised
their shields. <br>
DUKAT: You're wasting time. Xepolite ships can reach a maximum speed of
warp nine point eight. If they decide to run, we'll never catch them. <br>
KIRA: Well what would you suggest? <br>
DUKAT: I would breach their shields with my phasers and destroy their
bridge. <br>
KIRA: Killing everyone there. <br>
DUKAT: That's correct. Then I would lock onto the ship with my tractor
beam and tow it and its cargo back to the station. Very simple, very
effective. <br>
SISKO: And needlessly bloody. <br>
KIRA: Sounds like a Cardassian plan to me. <br>
SISKO: Chief, fire a phaser over their bow. Let's see if we can get
their attention. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. That woke them up. They're hailing us. <br>
SISKO: On my monitor, Chief. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: I am Drofo Awa, Hetman of this vessel. What do you
want from us? <br>
SISKO: I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko of the United Federation of
Planets. We believe you're carrying Cardassian weapons to their
colonies in the Demilitarised zone. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: Well then you believe wrong, Commander. My ship is
carrying five kilotons of Regreein wheat husks, nothing more. <br>
SISKO: Five kilotons. That's a lot of wheat husks. With your permission
I'd like to come aboard and see what that looks like. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: Permission denied. And if there's any attempt to
board my vessel, I will consider it an act of piracy. Is that clear? <br>
SISKO: Call it anything you like, but you're not going anywhere until
we search your ship. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: In that case, Commander <br>
DUKAT: In that case, you will do exactly as you're told. You will allow
us free access to your ship, so that we can
verify that you are indeed carrying Cardassian weapons into the
Demilitarised zone. You will then follow us back to Deep Space Nine,
where your cargo will be confiscated and you will make a full
confession detailing everything you know about the smuggling of weapons
into the Demilitarised zone. Then you will then sign that confession,
after which you and your ship will be allowed on your way. Is that
clear? <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: I don't understand. You're a Cardassian. <br>
DUKAT: I'm not just any Cardassian. I'm Gul Dukat, Commander of the
Second Order. You have fifteen seconds to lower your shields or we'll
destroy your ship. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: No, wait! <br>
DUKAT: Ten seconds. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: It's not that simple. <br>
DUKAT: Seven seconds. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: I've already been paid! <br>
DUKAT: Four seconds. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: Stop counting! Stop counting. <br>
O'BRIEN: He's lowering his shields. <br>
DROFO [on monitor]: I'll await your arrival, Commander. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
DUKAT: I think you can handle it from here.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: I hope you're happy. <br>
SAKONNA: I am a Vulcan. My emotional state is irrelevant. <br>
QUARK: Well I'm a Ferengi, and my emotional state is very relevant, and
right now I'm miserable and it's all your fault. <br>
SAKONNA: You were well paid for your assistance. <br>
QUARK: Not well enough. Look, I know the Cardassians can't be trusted.
I know the Central Command would like nothing better than to destroy
the Federation colonies in the Demilitarised zone. <br>
SAKONNA: Then you agree with our position? <br>
QUARK: Not for a second. <br>
SAKONNA: Why not? <br>
QUARK: Because your position is illogical. <br>
SAKONNA: Do you propose to lecture me on logic? <br>
QUARK: I don't want to, but you leave me no choice. It all comes down
to the third Rule of Acquisition. You don't know that one, do you? <br>
SAKONNA: I am not well versed in Ferengi philosophy. <br>
QUARK: Remind me to give you a copy of the Rules. You never know when
they'll come in handy. Now, the third rule clearly states, 'Never spend
more for an acquisition than you have to.' <br>
SAKONNA: Logical, but I fail to see how that applies to my situation. <br>
QUARK: You want to acquire peace. Fine. Peace is good. But how much are
you willing to pay for it? <br>
SAKONNA: Whatever it costs. <br>
QUARK: That's the kind of irresponsible spending that causes so many
business ventures to fail. You're forgetting the third rule. Right now
peace could be bought at a bargain price and you don't even realise it.
<br>
SAKONNA: I find this very confusing. <br>
QUARK: Then I'll make it so simple that even a Vulcan can understand.
The Central Command has been caught red-handed smuggling weapons to
their settlers. So, every ship that approaches the Demilitarised zone
will be searched. Without the support of the Central Command, the
Cardassian settlers won't be so eager to fight. <br>
SAKONNA: You forget the weapons they already have. <br>
QUARK: They have weapons. You have weapons. Everyone has weapons. But
right now, no one has a clear advantage. So the price of peace is at an
all-time low. This is the perfect time to sit down and hammer out an
agreement. Don't you get it? Attacking the Cardassians now will only
escalate the conflict and make peace more expensive in the long run.
Now, I ask you, is that logical?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT: A concealed weapons depot located within a
civilian population centre? <br>
SISKO: According to Sakonna, the Maquis are going to attack the depot
sometime within the next fifty-two hours. <br>
DUKAT: But she didn't tell you on which colony the depot's hidden? <br>
SISKO: She says she doesn't know. <br>
DUKAT: How convenient. <br>
SISKO: I believe her. <br>
DUKAT: Why? Because Vulcans don't lie? <br>
SISKO: As a rule, they don't. <br>
DUKAT: They don't blow up ships either, as a rule. But let's assume she
is telling the truth. I take it you haven't shared this information
with the Central Command? <br>
SISKO: No. I haven't. <br>
DUKAT: Good. Because they would never trust you to handle this matter
alone. <br>
SISKO: But they would be able to tell me where the weapons depot is
located. <br>
DUKAT: Leave that to me. I may no longer be a favourite with Central
Command, but I know people who are. <br>
SISKO: In the meantime, I'll go to Volan Three, try to talk some sense
into the Maquis. <br>
DUKAT: And if you can't? <br>
SISKO: Don't worry, Dukat. I told you I'd stop the Maquis, and one way
or another I will.

five people had to be hospitalised on Umoth Eight after eating from
public food replicators. Sabotage is suspected. <br>
AMAROS: Then from now on, guards should be posted at all public
replicators throughout the colonies. <br>
KOBB: Thank you. Now, about the new curfew. <br>
(Enter Sisko) <br>
KOBB: Commander Sisko, what a pleasant surprise. If you'll just wait a
moment, I'll finish up this meeting and we can talk privately. <br>
SISKO: That won't be necessary. I want everyone to hear what I have to
say. I don't know how many of you here actually belong to the Maquis.
Those of you who don't probably have friends who do. So please make
sure you pass along what I'm about to tell you. There is a treaty
currently in place between Cardassia and the Federation. If you make
yourself the enemy of Cardassia, you make yourself the enemy of the
Federation. <br>
AMAROS: That is outrageous! <br>
KOBB: Agreed. <br>
SISKO: I know the Maquis is planning to attack a Cardassian weapons
depot. My advice to them and to you is to call it off, because I'll be
waiting there and I'll stop you. <br>
(the Maquis enter - including a Bolian, a Klingon woman, native
Americans.) <br>
HUDSON: A very rousing speech, Ben. I suppose my best rebuttal would be
to kill you. <br>
SISKO: But you won't. <br>
(Sisko puts a bag on the table.) <br>
HUDSON: What is this? <br>
SISKO: Your uniform. <br>
HUDSON: You always were an optimist. <br>
SISKO: I have reason to be. The way I see it, now that we've stopped
the shipments of Cardassian weapons, there's no longer any need for the
Maquis. You and I can work together to reach a peace agreement with the
Cardassian colonies. <br>
HUDSON: It's too late for that. <br>
SISKO: Is it? <br>
HUDSON: We're in a war here, and I intend to win it. I could use your
help, Ben, and I'm asking you as a friend. <br>
SISKO: As a friend, I have to say no. If you attack that depot, you'll
have to get through me first. <br>
HUDSON: I hope not. I truly hope not. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT: The Bryma Colony. According to my sources,
that's the location of the weapons depot. <br>
SISKO: Then our objective is simple. Prevent the Maquis ships from
reaching Bryma. <br>
DAX: We're going to have to intercept them before they're picked up by
the colony's sensors. <br>
KIRA: Good point. If the Cardassian settlers even suspect they might
come under attack, they'll send a message to Cardassia asking for
reinforcements. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't care how much the Cardassians care about the treaty.
If the Maquis launch an assault against a civilian target, the Central
Command will have to respond. <br>
SISKO: We could wind up with a full scale war on our hands. We have to
stop the Maquis. Our runabouts will take up a defensive position just
outside the Bryma colony's sensor range. <br>
O'BRIEN: The best way to detect incoming ships would be to hide a
couple of dozen sensor probes in the system's Oort Cloud. That way, we
can spot the Maquis no matter what route they take. <br>
BASHIR: How many Maquis ships are we expecting? <br>
ODO: According to Sakonna, they only have two ships capable of mounting
the weapons she purchased. <br>
BASHIR: So we'll have three ships and they'll have two. The odds are in
our favour, anyway. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's not going to give us much of an advantage, Julian. The
colonists are used to being outnumbered. They'll fight just that much
harder. <br>
DAX: How do you propose to stop them? <br>
DUKAT: What's that human expression? Shoot to kill. <br>
SISKO: We'll try to stop them with words if possible, with force if
necessary. <br>
KIRA: So if they fire at us, we have orders to shoot back? <br>
SISKO: That's correct. We'll target their warp engines and weapons
arrays, try to disable them. <br>
