pattern onto the sandy floor where a wizened and tattered old man is
sitting drawing a pattern with his fingers. A klaxon sounds. <br>
ARGRATHI [OC]: All offenders prepare for decontamination.
Decontamination will proceed immediately. <br>
(The prisoner curls up tight as a green light sweeps the room, erasing
his pattern and making him groan with pain. Once it is passed, he
starts again. The door unseals and opens. The prisoner stands. The
Prison governor enters with an armed escort.) <br>
RINN: Miles Edward O'Brien. The Argrathi Authority has been conducting
a review of your case. Do you wish to add anything to the official
record? <br>
(O'Brien shakes his grizzled, bearded head.) <br>
RINN: No matter. Your correction is completed. You are free. <br>
O'BRIEN: Free? <br>
RINN: The crime of espionage requires a minimum of fifteen cycles of
correction. You've been here for twenty. It's time for you to go. <br>
O'BRIEN: Go? I can't leave. Where would I go to? <br>
RINN: That's not my concern. Remove him. <br>

the bright light outside the cell.) </font></p>

unfastens him.) <br>
RINN: There. It's done. <br>
O'BRIEN: Major? <br>
KIRA: It's me, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: It can't be. It's been twenty years. You haven't changed at
all. <br>
RINN: Only a few hours passed during your correction. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't understand. <br>
KIRA: Chief, I know this is going to be hard for you to accept, but you
haven't been in prison. What you experienced was an artificial reality,
an interactive programme that created memories of things that never
actually happened. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
RINN: The Major is correct. We punish our offenders by giving them
memories of incarceration modelled to fit each offender's personality.
It's more efficient and much more effective than maintaining an
extensive prison system. <br>
KIRA: Which means that what you think you experienced in prison, the
things you remember, didn't happen. It wasn't real. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's real to me, Major. It's real to me.

Argrathi technology and asked a few too many questions. The Argrathi
security arrested him and charged him with espionage. <br>
KEIKO: But Miles would never break the law intentionally. <br>
SISKO: I know that. But by the time the Argrathi told us what had
happened, they had already carried out his correction. <br>
KEIKO: Can the memories that they implanted be removed? <br>
SISKO: The Argrathi claim it's impossible, but Doctor Bashir will do
his best. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: The bottom line is, there isn't much I can
do. The Argrathi didn't just install memory implants. They ran Miles
through a highly realistic time-compressed simulation of the prison
experience. In his mind, he lived those twenty years. He reacted to
everything that happened. He felt pain, fear, hatred. He made choices
and decisions that affected the outcome. As a result, those memories
are real. The only way I could rid him of the memories would be to wipe
his entire memory clean, and clearly that isn't an option. <br>
KEIKO: I understand. <br>
BASHIR: Listen, Keiko, he's been through some terrible things in his
life, as you know. During the war on Setlik Three. That time he was
taken prisoner by the Paradans. During his trial on Cardassia Prime.
And he's always survived. In the long run, he's going to be okay. It's
just going to take some time.

O'BRIEN: Nothing. <br>
KEIKO: I mean, with your food. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's just a habit I picked up in prison. The guards didn't
care much whether I lived or died. Sometimes they wouldn't deliver food
for days, weeks even. When they did feed me, I ate as little as
possible and save the rest. <br>

EE'CHAR: For later. <br>
O'BRIEN: How did you manage? Six years in here all by yourself. <br>
EE'CHAR: Oh, you find ways. I'd exercise, tell myself stories, draw
eseekas on the ground. <br>
O'BRIEN: Eseekas? <br>
EE'CHAR: Geometric patterns. Drawing them is a way to relax your body
and occupy the mind. <br>

(O'Brien copies him) <br>
EE'CHAR: Now gaze into the circle. You want to learn or not? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm gazing. <br>
EE'CHAR: Relax your mind. Imagine that the circle encompasses your
whole existence. Let it become a part of you. Now without thinking,
allow your hand to make a mark inside the circle. Now expand on the
mark. Let it grow organically until it becomes a pattern. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you laughing at? <br>
EE'CHAR: You look like a reeta-hawk picking at a corpse. Awk! Awk! <br>
O'BRIEN: How do you do that? <br>
EE'CHAR: What, awk? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, laugh after six years in here. <br>
EE'CHAR: Well, after six years in a place like this, you either learn
to laugh or you go insane. I prefer to laugh. <br>

BASHIR: So, you're supposed to see him three times a week. <br>
O'BRIEN: What for? All Telnorri ever wants to do is sit and listen to
me tell stories of what it was like to be in an Argrathi prison. How
often did they beat me? Was I distressed by the lack of toilet
facilities? If you ask me, he's the one with the problem. <br>
BASHIR: You can talk to a different counsellor. Someone you might like
better. <br>

forget about what happened on Argratha and get on with my life. <br>

time to adjust. I just want to be left alone. <br>

O'BRIEN: I talked to him all right. He relieved me of duty. <br>

O'BRIEN: How do you know what's best for me? You have no idea what I've
been going through. <br>
BASHIR: You're right. You were alone in that cell. I wasn't there with
you. I didn't see what they did to you. But I do know you suffered and
that you're still suffering right now. And I'm trying to help. <br>
O'BRIEN: I never asked for your help. <br>
BASHIR: You didn't need to ask. I'm your doctor and your friend. <br>
EE'CHAR: You should listen to him, Miles. He cares about you just like
I did. Don't make the same mistake with him you did with me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't you get it. You're not my friend. Not anymore. The
O'Brien that was your friend died in that cell. <br>
BASHIR: He's not dead. He just needs a little help, that's all. <br>
O'BRIEN: Stay away from me. I don't want your help, I don't want your
friendship. I just want to be left alone.

If I keep coming back, it's because some part of you keeps bringing me

O'BRIEN: The hell I don't. <br>
BASHIR: Look, I don't claim to know what you're going through, but
whatever it is, it's not worth dying for. <br>
O'BRIEN: You don't understand at all. I'm not doing this for me. I'm
doing this to protect Keiko, and Molly and everyone else on the
station. <br>
BASHIR: Protect us from what? <br>
O'BRIEN: From me. I'm not the man I used to be. I'm dangerous. I nearly
hit Molly today. All she wanted was a little attention and I nearly hit
her. <br>
BASHIR: But you didn't. You're a good man, Miles Edward O'Brien. And
whatever it is you think you've done wrong, you don't deserve to die. <br>
O'BRIEN: You sound like Ee'Char. <br>
BASHIR: Who's Ee'Char? <br>
(Ee'Char appears) <br>
O'BRIEN: He's not real. He's just a memory, that's all. <br>
BASHIR: A memory from Argratha? Who was he? Another prisoner? A guard? <br>
O'BRIEN: He was my cell mate. <br>
BASHIR: You told me you were alone in that cell. Twenty years with no
one to talk to. <br>
O'BRIEN: I was at the end. A week, two maybe. But the rest of the time
there was Ee'char. <br>

EE'CHAR: So am I. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're sure there's nothing left? <br>
EE'CHAR: Not unless you have a hiding place I don't know about. <br>
O'BRIEN: We ate the last of the food I put away a week ago. We should
have stockpiled more. We should have planned for this. <br>
EE'CHAR: They've never let us go this long without food before. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe they've forgotten about us, or just decided to finally
let us die. <br>
EE'CHAR: Then we die. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: You killed him? <br>
O'BRIEN: And the worst part of it was, the next day the guards began
feeding me again. I'd killed him for nothing, for a scrap of bread he
was going to share with me. <br>
BASHIR: But it was a mistake. You didn't mean it. <br>
O'BRIEN: I meant it. I wanted him to die. I keep telling myself it
doesn't matter. It wasn't real. But that's a lie. If it had been real,
if it had been you instead of him, it wouldn't have made any
difference. He was my best friend and I murdered him. When we were
growing up, they used to tell us humanity had evolved, that mankind had
outgrown hate and rage. But when it came down to it, when I had the
chance to show that no matter what anyone did to me, I was still an
evolved human being, I failed. I repaid kindness with blood. I was no
better than an animal. <br>
BASHIR: No, no, no, no. An animal would've killed Ee'char and never had
a second thought, never shed a tear. But not you. You hate yourself.
You hate yourself so much you think you deserve to die. The Argrathi
did everything they could to strip you of your humanity. And in the
end, for one brief moment, they succeeded. But you can't let that brief
moment define your entire life. If you do, if you pull that trigger,
then the Argrathi will have won. They will have destroyed a good man.
You cannot let that happen, my friend. <br>
(O'Brien lets Bashir take the phaser and reduce the power level.) <br>
EE'CHAR: Miles. Be well, Miles. <br>

take the edge off the depression. But that's all it'll do. It won't
take away the memories or the feelings. <br>
