wedding dress. Quark and Ziyal wait for a decision.) <br>
ROM: What do you think? <br>
LEETA: I don't know. What do you think? <br>
ROM: I like it. Don't you? <br>
LEETA: Rom, it's two handkerchiefs and a loincloth. <br>
ROM: I suppose we could lose the handkerchiefs. <br>
LEETA: Ferengi tradition or no Ferengi tradition, I am not going to be
naked at my wedding. <br>
ROM: Who said anything about naked? You'll still have the loincloth. <br>
LEETA: Please show us something else. <br>
GARAK: There is nothing else. I've shown you one hundred and fifty
three different wedding dresses, from
Tellarite modern to Risian traditional, and you've hated them all. <br>
LEETA: I liked number thirty eight. <br>
ROM: Number thirty eight? It had more layers than a Baduvian tapestry. <br>
LEETA: It was elegant. <br>
ROM: It was bulky. <br>
ZIYAL: I like sixty four. <br>
LEETA: Sixty four? <br>
ROM: Eeeesh. <br>
GARAK: Well, at least they agree on something. <br>
ZIYAL: Why don't you just let Garak design a dress on his own? You know
whatever he comes up with will be beautiful. <br>
GARAK: My dear, I find your blind adoration both flattering and
disturbing, but she does have a point. <br>
QUARK: Leeta, that fifteen minute break you asked for was up an hour
ago. <br>
ROM: Brother, what do you think of this dress? <br>
QUARK: I don't want to think about it. All I know is that any marriage
where the female is allowed to speak and wear clothing is doomed to
failure. Your dabo table awaits. <br>

I wish I could convince Jake to visit Earth for a while. <br>
LEETA: Captain, can we speak to you for a moment? <br>
ROM: If you're not too busy. <br>
SISKO: Oh. Go ahead. <br>
ROM: Would you marry me? I mean, us. I mean, would you perform our

LEETA: It would be a great honour to be married by the Emissary. <br>

get ready. <br>

SISKO: I'll say one thing for the Dominion, they're punctual. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's the fifth convoy headed to Cardassia in the last five

there by now. <br>
SISKO: Too many. <br>

is a lot of yamok sauce. What is a yamok, anyway? <br>

DAX: Major? <br>

DAX: You and Odo. You've been avoiding each other for weeks. <br>
KIRA: Ah, it's a long story. <br>
DAX: Those are the best kind. <br>
KIRA: Odo has feelings for me. <br>
DAX: What kind of feelings? <br>
KIRA: The kind that aren't easy to talk about. <br>
DAX: Since when? <br>
KIRA: Since I don't know. Years. I just found out about it last month. <br>

NOG: Sixty degrees Celsius. Just the way you like it. Sir, is it true
what they're saying about the Romulans? <br>
SISKO: What do they say? <br>
NOG: There were some Orion free traders in Quark's last night, and they
heard from a Vulcan diplomat that the Romulans signed a non-aggression
pact with the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: A lot of rumours float around at a time like this, Cadet. Just
don't forget the one hundred ninetieth Rule of Acquisition. <br>
NOG: Hear all, trust nothing. Good advice, sir. <br>
(Nog leaves.) <br>
SISKO: The Romulans. Sisko to Dax. <br>
DAX [OC]: Dax here. <br>
SISKO: Put me through to Starfleet Intelligence.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: The Romulans! I always knew they were without
honour. Now they have proven it. <br>
BASHIR: When did they sign the treaty? <br>
SISKO: Yesterday. <br>
O'BRIEN: They must be desperate to side with the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: Technically they're not siding with anyone. It's a
non-aggression pact. <br>
KIRA: Which means if the Dominion attacks, they just sit by and do
nothing. <br>
ODO: The Romulans, the Miradorn, the Tholians. The Dominion is making
impressive inroads in the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
DAX: And the Bajorans are still talking to them? <br>
KIRA: My people will never sign that treaty, or any other agreement
with the Dominion. <br>
O'BRIEN: Meanwhile, more Jem'Hadar ships come through the wormhole
every week. <br>
WORF: It must stop. <br>
SISKO: It's going to stop. I've talked to Starfleet Command. They've
agreed that no more Dominion ships can be allowed into the Alpha
Quadrant. <br>
O'BRIEN: How do we keep them out? <br>
SISKO: We're going to mine the entrance to the wormhole, prevent the
Dominion from bringing any more reinforcements to Cardassia. <br>
ODO: If we try to stop those convoys, it may very well start a war. <br>
SISKO: Maybe so. But one thing is certain. We're losing the peace,
which means a war could be our only hope.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dax's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: What about pulse mines? We could equip
them with variable geometry detonators. <br>
DAX: Not good enough. Dominion ships can wait at the mouth of the
wormhole and pick them off one by one. <br>
O'BRIEN: What if we cloaked them? <br>
DAX: Cloaking doesn't always work against the Dominion. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe cloaked ships don't, but I'm thinking a lot smaller.
Each mine no more than a metre across. <br>
DAX: Mines that small don't have a lot of power. It would take dozens
of them to disable a warship. We'd run out of mines before they ran out
of ships. Rom, are you here? <br>
ROM: Cloak. Small. Dozens. I heard every word. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, something's wrong. You haven't touched your food. <br>
ROM: It's my stomach. Ever since Captain Sisko agreed to officiate at
our wedding, I haven't had much of an appetite. <br>
O'BRIEN: I thought you wanted Captain Sisko to marry you. <br>
ROM: I did. But now that he's said yes, it's become so real. I'm going
to get married! <br>
DAX: Not for another two weeks. And in the meantime, we have work to
do. <br>
ROM: But what if Leeta turns out to be just like Nog's mother? What if
I can't make her happy? What if this is the biggest mistake of my life?
What if <br>
O'BRIEN: Rom. <br>
ROM: Self-replication. That's the only answer. <br>
DAX: Self-replication? <br>
ROM: If the mines are going to be small, we'll need a lot of them. And
we'll need a way to replace them quickly if the Jem'Hadar try to blast
their way through. And, uh-oh. I forgot to request new quarters. Mine
are too small. Where are Leeta and I going to live? <br>
DAX: Rom, I think you're on to something. <br>
ROM: I know I am. I've measured them three times. There's nowhere to
put her prayer mandala. <br>
O'BRIEN: We could equip each mine with a replicator unit. <br>
DAX: No matter how many the Jem'Hadar destroy, there'd always be more. <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll program them to swarm detonate. Twenty or thirty mines
to each ship. <br>
ROM: The only problem is you'll have to wait until the entire minefield
is deployed before you activate it. Otherwise the proximity sensors
could cause premature detonation. Where's Leeta going to put all her
clothes? I don't have enough closet space. <br>
DAX: I'd better go talk to Sisko. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll go draw up some specs. <br>
ROM: I've got to go to waste extraction.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: What did Starfleet Command say? <br>
WORF: How many reinforcements will they be sending us? <br>
KIRA: And how soon will they get here? <br>
SISKO: We're not getting any reinforcements. We'll have to make due
with what we've got. <br>
KIRA: What we've got isn't enough. <br>
WORF: Sir, as Strategic Operations Officer, I cannot guarantee the
safety of this station if a Dominion fleet attacks. <br>
SISKO: Your concerns are noted, Commander. <br>
KIRA: What's Starfleet thinking? They must have given you a reason for
denying your request. <br>
SISKO: They did. <br>
KIRA: And? <br>
SISKO: And I'm not at liberty to discuss it. Let's just say Starfleet's
resources will be needed elsewhere. <br>
KIRA: What could be more important than defending this station? <br>
WORF: That is not for us to decide. What are our orders, Captain? <br>
SISKO: Deploy the minefield and prepare for a Dominion attack. <br>
KIRA: And when the attack comes? <br>
SISKO: Then we are to defend the station until the mines are in
position and the field has been activated. <br>
WORF: The Defiant will be unable to raise shields or cloak while
deploying the mines. She will be an easy target. <br>
SISKO: Then it's up to DS9 to defend her. If the Dominion wants to stop
the Defiant, they'll have to come through us.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: You wanted to see me, Constable? <br>
ODO: Major, I'd like your permission to terminate all outgoing subspace
communications. <br>
KIRA: You really think that's necessary? <br>
ODO: This is no time for security leaks. I've prepared a number of
false messages we can transmit at random intervals so there won't be
any noticeable drop in our outgoing subspace traffic. <br>
KIRA: I'll see what I can do. <br>
ODO: I'd appreciate that. Major, there's something you ought to know. <br>
KIRA: What's that? <br>
ODO: I've been thinking about asking out you to dinner. <br>
KIRA: I've been expecting something like this. <br>
ODO: I could tell. You've looked a little uncomfortable around me
lately. <br>
KIRA: You've looked a little uncomfortable yourself. <br>
ODO: Which is why I wanted you to know I'm not going to do it. No
dinner invitations, no flowers, no attempts at changing the nature of
our relationship. Until the current crisis has passed, we both need our
minds to be clear, to be free of any unnecessary distractions. <br>
KIRA: That's probably a good idea. So, for now, all we need to concern
ourselves with is deploying the minefield, maintaining station security
and preparing ourselves for a possible invasion. <br>
ODO: Well, I don't know about you, but I feel more comfortable already.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 50975.2. The next Jem'Hadar
convoy is due in five days, but our efforts to mine the wormhole have
already provoked a response from the Dominion, who have sent their
Vorta Ambassador, Weyoun, to speak with me.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: What can I do for you, Weyoun? <br>
WEYOUN: Captain Sisko. I'll make this brief. We know all about the
minefield. <br>
SISKO: I assumed you'd find out sooner or later. <br>
WEYOUN: As I see it, you have two choices. Either you remove the mines
or we will take this station from you and remove them ourselves. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate your directness. Now let me be direct with you. The
mines stay. I will not allow any more Dominion reinforcements through
the wormhole. <br>
WEYOUN: You will not allow? <br>
SISKO: You heard me. <br>
WEYOUN: I can see how that might be your first reaction. But you and I
are reasonable men, and surely reasonable men can come to some sort of
mutually acceptable compromise. <br>
SISKO: I didn't think the Dominion believed in compromise. <br>
WEYOUN: It saddens me to see how deeply you misunderstand us. All the
Dominion wants is to peacefully co-exist with its neighbours. <br>
SISKO: Then why the continued military buildup? Why the weekly convoys
of troops and ships from the Gamma Quadrant? <br>
WEYOUN: It's the Cardassians. Don't get me wrong. I'm pleased to call
them allies, but as you know they've just been though a terrible war
with the Klingons. I'm afraid it's left them somewhat jittery. So
they're understandably concerned with insuring the sovereignty of their
borders. And since they're now members of the Dominion, their concerns
have become our concerns. <br>
SISKO: I would think by now you have more than enough ships to defend
Cardassia. <br>
WEYOUN: You may think that, and I may think that, but the Cardassians <br>
SISKO: Oh, yes, I know. They're jittery. <br>
WEYOUN: You see our dilemma. <br>
SISKO: I'm beginning to. <br>
WEYOUN: What if we agreed to limit our convoys to cargo ships,
construction units, civilian aid? Things that will help them get their
economy back on its feet. Did you know when we arrived, children were
starving on Cardassia Prime? It was heartbreaking. <br>
SISKO: I had no idea things were so bad. <br>
WEYOUN: The Cardassians are a very proud people. They don't want to
admit to outsiders how dire their situation really is. So, are we
agreed? You remove the mines and we restrict our convoys to medical and
economic assistance. <br>
SISKO: That sounds reasonable. I'd have to discuss it with Starfleet
first, of course. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm sure they'll do whatever Benjamin Sisko recommends. For my
part, I will personally speak to the Founders to secure our end of the
bargain. <br>
SISKO: What about Gul Dukat? <br>
WEYOUN: Ah. He'll be furious, at first. But we've developed a fine
working relationship, and I'm sure I can help him to see the wisdom of
our decision. <br>
SISKO: I will leave it in your capable hands. <br>
WEYOUN: You won't be disappointed. This is a momentous day. You and I
have just taken the first step towards insuring peace between our
peoples.

BASHIR: Are you sure? <br>
SISKO: I am positive. The moment I mentioned that we weren't going to
remove the mines, we both knew there'd be war. Everything else was just
words, a feeble attempt to lull the other side into a false sense of
security. I didn't buy it, and I'm sure Weyoun didn't either. <br>
WORF: How soon? <br>
SISKO: As soon as they can get their fleet from Cardassia. I'd say as
early as tomorrow. Which means we have to finish the minefield today. <br>
DAX [on monitor]: We need more time. <br>

can. We're going to need you here. <br>

more ships? Say fifty? <br>

ships. <br>
SISKO: Forget the Militia. I need you to contact the Council of
Ministers. Tell them I need to meet with them immediately. <br>
KIRA: As a Starfleet Captain or as the Emissary of the Prophets? <br>
SISKO: Both. <br>
KIRA: That'll get their attention. <br>
SISKO: Remember the non-aggression pact the Dominion offered Bajor a
few weeks ago? <br>
KIRA: They're still debating it in the Council of Ministers. It'll
never pass. <br>
SISKO: It'll pass if the Emissary endorses it. <br>
KIRA: You want Bajor to sign a treaty with the Dominion? Why? <br>
SISKO: Major, when I came here, my orders were to protect Bajor and
help your people rebuild from the Occupation. <br>
KIRA: We've succeeded. <br>
SISKO: And I refuse to see everything we've accomplished torn down
again. The sad truth is, Major, if there is a war now, the Federation
can't guarantee the safety of Bajor. Which means Bajor must be kept out
of the fighting. I don't like this any more than you do, Major, but
it's Bajor's only chance for survival.

GARAK: Well, let me tell you a story. I once knew a Cardassian, a
dashing, handsome young man with a promising career. But one day,
through no fault of his own, he found himself exiled and alone, with
nowhere to turn. But did he give up? No. He struck upon a brilliant
plan. Rather than fleeing for the rest of his life, he sought shelter
in the one place no one expected him to go. In a stronghold of his
people's most hated enemies. There, surrounded by hostile strangers, he
built a life, and there, against all odds, against the merciless logic
of the Universe itself, he thrived. <br>
ZIYAL: By becoming the greatest tailor in the galaxy. <br>
