Ilario, living proof that Starfleet Academy produces the finest fighter
pilots in the galaxy. <br>
O'BRIEN: Hear, hear. <br>
BASHIR: I haven't finished. <br>
KIRA: Don't ruin it, Julian. That was just what a toast should be.
Short and to the point. <br>
ILARIO: I wouldn't mind hearing a little more. <br>
EZRI: Now, now. Modesty above all. <br>
BASHIR: This is no time to be modesty. This man, this youth, this mere
pup still wet behind the ears. <br>
ILARIO: I'm twenty two. <br>
BASHIR: I was speaking metaphorically. This inspired cherub masterfully
piloted the Defiant into battle against a half dozen Jem'Hadar attack
ships, and once all the smoke had cleared, only one ship remained
intact, and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the USS Defiant. <br>
O'BRIEN: The kid's a born helmsman. <br>
BASHIR: And so say all of us. <br>
ALL: Hear, hear. <br>
ILARIO: Thanks. I'm just glad to be here. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's the best posting in the galaxy. <br>
BASHIR: If there's anything you want, anything at all, just ask. <br>
ILARIO: Well, there is one thing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Name it. <br>
ILARIO: Next time you two go to the holosuite, I'd like to come along. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sorry. <br>
BASHIR: Can't be done. <br>
O'BRIEN: No, it's out of the question. <br>
BASHIR: It's impossible. <br>
KIRA: Don't take it personally. They're very serious about their
leisure activities. <br>
BASHIR: It's a good way to relieve stress. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, I highly recommend it. <br>
BASHIR: Just not with us. <br>
O'BRIEN: No. You know, when you have a holosuite visit, it's sort of a
personal experience. <br>
BASHIR: He's very particular about anybody seeing him in his coonskin
cap. You understand. <br>
ILARIO: I suppose. <br>
QUARK: Gentlemen, your holosuite is ready. <br>
BASHIR: Terrific. Now if there's anything else you need? <br>
O'BRIEN: Just let us know. <br>

ILARIO: Have you ever gone to the holosuite with them? <br>
KIRA: Me? Never. <br>
EZRI: I know when I'm not wanted. <br>
(Later, the bar is almost empty.) <br>
ILARIO: To the class of seventy two. Another round? <br>
EZRI + KIRA: No. <br>
ILARIO: Time to go? <br>
KIRA: It was time to go about an hour ago. <br>
ILARIO: Okay. <br>
KIRA: Okay, we'll get you home. <br>
EZRI: I'll take him. His quarters are on my way. <br>
KIRA: Sure. <br>
EZRI: He won't be the first drunken Ensign I've escorted home. Someday

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Odo, Bashir and security are with a body) <br>
EZRI: What happened? <br>
ODO: Lieutenant Ilario has been killed. <br>
EZRI: Killed? How? <br>
BASHIR: It appears someone shot him. <br>
(After the opening titles, Sisko has arrived and O'Brien is doing the
CSI tricorder thing.) <br>
ODO: He was killed by what appears to have been some kind of chemically
propelled projectile weapon. <br>
SISKO: A gun? <br>
ODO: Doctor Bashir recovered a single tritanium bullet from Ilario's
chest. <br>
BASHIR: He was shot through the heart. <br>
O'BRIEN: You don't see one of those every day. <br>
ODO: No one uses projectile weapons anymore. <br>
SISKO: You said this is tritanium, right? <br>
ODO: That's correct. <br>
SISKO: Chief, did you ever hear of a TR one one six rifle? <br>
O'BRIEN: It was a prototype. Developed by Starfleet Security to operate
in energy dampening fields or radiogenic environments. <br>
SISKO: That's right. Anywhere where a normal phaser would be useless.
If I'm not mistaken, the TR one one six rifle fired a chemically
propelled tritanium bullet. <br>
ODO: You say a prototype. Were they ever mass produced? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. Starfleet abandoned the TR one one six in favour of
regenerative phasers. <br>
SISKO: That doesn't mean the killer couldn't have gotten hold of the
rifle's replication patterns. <br>
O'BRIEN: But only Starfleet officers have access to those files. <br>
SISKO: Disturbing thought, isn't it? <br>
BASHIR: Starfleet officers do not go around murdering other officers. <br>
ODO: Not usually, anyway. <br>
O'BRIEN: Hold on a minute. That's odd. According to these readings, the
bullet only travelled eight or nine centimetres. <br>
SISKO: Then the killer must have fired at point blank range. <br>
ODO: I don't think so. There are no powder burns on the body. <br>
BASHIR: What are powder burns? <br>
ODO: At close range, chemically propelled weapons leave residual
combustion products on the skin and clothing of the victims. <br>
SISKO: How did you know that? <br>
ODO: I read twentieth century crime novels. Raymond Chandler, Mike
Hammer, that sort of thing. <br>
SISKO: So, if the killer did fire from close range, why aren't there
any powder burns? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know. <br>
ODO: But we'll find out. <br>
EZRI: What was the time of death? <br>
BASHIR: Oh three seventeen. <br>
EZRI: That's only ten minutes after I left. <br>
SISKO: Was he alone? <br>
EZRI: I didn't see anyone, but I wasn't here for very long. <br>
SISKO: What do we know about Ilario, outside of his service record? <br>
ODO: Not a great deal. He's only been on the station for ten days. <br>
EZRI: As far as I could tell, he was intelligent, dedicated, eager to
please. Everyone liked him. <br>
SISKO: Not everyone. I want to know everything there is to know about
him. Who his friends were, if he made any enemies. I also want
increased security throughout the station. <br>
ODO: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: And Constable <br>
ODO: You want whoever did this caught. I understand, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Ilario once told me he came from a big
family. Three brothers and two sisters. <br>
O'BRIEN: I thought it was two brothers and three sisters. <br>
BASHIR: I don't think so. <br>
O'BRIEN: You sure? <br>
BASHIR: Are you? <br>
EZRI: Don't look at me. We never discussed his family. Mostly he talked
about the Academy and about the two of you. <br>
BASHIR: Us? <br>
EZRI: He really admired both of you. <br>
BASHIR: We should have let him come to the holosuite with us. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're right, we should've. <br>
EZRI: I just wish I hadn't left his quarters so quickly. Maybe he'd
still be alive. <br>
BASHIR: Or you'd be dead right there with him. <br>
EZRI: Odo will catch whoever did this, won't he? <br>
BASHIR: If anyone can. <br>

EZRI: Shouldn't you be in bed? <br>
BASHIR: I was about to ask you the same question. <br>
EZRI: I just couldn't sleep. <br>
BASHIR: Me neither. You mustn't blame yourself, you know, for Ilario's
death. <br>
EZRI: I don't, not really. <br>
BASHIR: Then what is it? <br>
EZRI: It's just knowing that he was murdered. <br>
BASHIR: It's difficult to accept. The whole concept of someone killing
another person in cold blood, it's almost incomprehensible, isn't it? <br>
EZRI: Not to me. <br>
BASHIR: Meaning what? <br>
EZRI: Meaning that I know exactly what it feels like. To feel the urge,
the need, to take a life. <br>
BASHIR: You're talking about Joran. <br>
EZRI: He killed three people. He was a host to the Dax symbiont, just
like me. <br>
BASHIR: He was nothing like you. <br>
EZRI: I try not to think about it. Jadzia felt the same way. She tried
to bury his memories as deeply as she could. But they're still there.
The victims. What they looked like. <br>
BASHIR: They weren't your victims. <br>
EZRI: I know. But then something like this happens. Just the thought of
someone like him being here right now. <br>
BASHIR: You really should get some rest. <br>

thirty seven. Twelve years of service, the last three here on Deep
Space Nine. <br>
BASHIR: Cause of death, tritanium bullet fired at close range. No
powder burns. <br>
SISKO: Did Ilario and Vanderweg know each other? <br>
ODO: I'll look into to it, but it's doubtful. Ilario was only here for
ten days, seven of them he was on the Defiant. <br>
SISKO: But why Ilario? And why Vanderweg? Did someone have a personal
grudge against either one of them? Or is someone just killing our
officers at random? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: I wonder why he chose a TR one one six? <br>
BASHIR: Instead of a phaser? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah. I mean, why use a rifle if you're going to shoot
somebody from close range? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know. He or she may have originally intended to kill
their victims from a great distance, so they replicated a long-range
weapon. Or they had some special connection to this particular rifle. A
fetish or psychological obsession, perhaps? <br>
O'BRIEN: I suppose so. <br>
BASHIR: Did you ever read that biography I gave you on Davy Crockett
last month? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. But I'll get to it. <br>
BASHIR: There was this fascinating section about the mythology that
grew up around Crockett and his rifle. There was this notion that a man
could have a special relationship with a weapon. Some frontiersmen even
went so far as to give their rifles names, female ones at that, thus
changing the relationship between owner and object to something
resembling man and woman. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe I'll start calling my tricorder Sally. <br>
BASHIR: There's some great tall tales in that book. There's one
particular story where Crockett was supposed to have put up a target
against a tree and arranged a series of tin frying pans nearby in a
complicated pattern. The idea was that he was going to shoot a bullet
at one of these pans which would then ricochet to another and then to
another and then to another and then to another. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wait a minute. That's it. Displaced targeting. That's how he
did it. <br>
BASHIR: Who? <br>
O'BRIEN: The killer. He set up an alternate bullet trajectory, one that
didn't require a direct line of sight between him and the victim.
Julian, you're a genius. <br>
BASHIR: Don't thank me, thank Davy Crockett.

ODO: Go ahead, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Are you ready? <br>
EZRI: For what? <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: You'll see. First put on those goggles that are on the

little further. I've only done this a couple of times. <br>
EZRI: How's this? <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Good. <br>

O'BRIEN: Wow. <br>
ODO: Are you all right? <br>
EZRI: Better than that melon. <br>
O'BRIEN: It worked! I was able to fire a bullet into that melon while
standing outside in the corridor. <br>
EZRI: You fired through the wall? <br>
ODO: I don't see any bullet holes. <br>
O'BRIEN: I attached a micro transporter to this TR one one six. When I
fired, the bullet was beamed into this room a few centimetres away from
the melon. <br>
ODO: Where it continued its trajectory. So if the killer used a similar
transporter device, that would explain the lack of powder burns on the
victims. <br>
O'BRIEN: And by using an exographic targeting sensor, he was able to
scan through the bulkheads. <br>
ODO: So he could have been firing from anywhere on the station. Can you
trace the bullet's transporter signatures back to where the killer was
when he fired? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm afraid not. The signature is too weak. <br>
ODO: It's an ingenious weapon. <br>

EZRI: I'm holding the gun. <br>
JORAN: Stop placating me. You wanted my help? Now do as I say. Put on
the targeting display. <br>
(Ezri puts the yellow lens over her left eye.) <br>
JORAN: Now, hold the weapon as if you're going to use it. Feels good,
doesn't it? <br>
EZRI: I've held a rifle before. <br>
JORAN: You mean in combat? It's not the same thing. That kind of
killing's too random, too chaotic. This is more controlled. You can
savour the moment. Now, tell me, what do you see? <br>
EZRI: I'm moving through different levels of the docking ring. <br>
JORAN: He didn't kill anyone in the docking ring. Remember, you're
trying to put yourself in his mind. Move to the habitat ring. <br>
EZRI: I'm there. In one of the corridors. <br>
JORAN: Good. Our killer is a hunter. So start hunting. <br>
EZRI: I see a Bajoran Deputy. <br>
JORAN: You don't want to be in the corridors. Look in the quarters. <br>
EZRI: No one's here. <br>
(Next door.) <br>
EZRI: A male Starfleet officer. An engineer, about thirty five. <br>
JORAN: Good. We have a victim. You have him in your sights. How do you
feel? Truth now. <br>
EZRI: Powerful. In control <br>
JORAN: That's good. That's what the killer's feeling. <br>
EZRI: I'm not angry or excited. <br>
JORAN: You're calm, relaxed. <br>
EZRI: Detached. <br>
JORAN: Now you're getting it. You do your killing from a distance.
You're cold, methodical. Maybe you're a scientist or a doctor? <br>
EZRI: Maybe. But why kill like this? Why not choose a victim on the
Promenade or in Quark's? <br>
JORAN: If you want to know the answer, pull the trigger and find out.
Don't think about it, do it! Do it! <br>
EZRI: No! <br>
(Ezri rips off the eyepiece and puts down the weapon.) <br>
JORAN: Ezri, the gun isn't loaded. <br>
EZRI: Then why did you tell me to pull the trigger? <br>
JORAN: Do you want to know what the killer feels or don't you?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JORAN: I'm sorry, Ezri. I didn't mean to push you
so far. <br>
EZRI: I'm not a murderer. I'm not you. <br>
JORAN: Maybe not, but you have my memories. You remember what it was
like. The excitement, the passion, the looks on their faces as they
realised we were the last thing they'd ever see. <br>
EZRI: That has nothing to do with me. You're the killer. <br>
QUARK: Ezri? I think you need a vacation. You're talking to yourself. <br>
EZRI: I'm just thinking out loud. <br>
JORAN: I don't know what you see in this Ferengi. He's repulsive. <br>
QUARK: Can I get you a drink or something to eat? <br>
JORAN: No, we don't have time. We have work to do.
EZRI: No, thanks. I'm not hungry, really. <br>
QUARK: Well, when you are, you know where to come. <br>
(Quark goes back to his cafe.) <br>
JORAN: How I'd love to slip a knife between his ribs. <br>
EZRI: I have a better idea. Let's get back to work. The sooner we find
our killer, the sooner you and I can part company. <br>
JORAN: I thought we were having fun together. <br>
EZRI: Think again. <br>
JORAN: I suppose I'll have to make myself more endearing. Now, I
suggest we visit the victims' quarters to see what answers we can find
there.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EZRI: What are we looking for? <br>
JORAN: Clues, what else? <br>
EZRI: We don't even know if the killer ever set foot in here. <br>
JORAN: Both victims were in their quarters when they were killed. Is
that a coincidence or a connection? <br>
EZRI: I don't know. <br>
JORAN: Think about it. Look around. And remember, whatever you see is
what the killer saw. What do we know about these classmates of
Ilario's? <br>
EZRI: Odo checked with Starfleet Command. The one on the left was
killed in combat five weeks ago. The one in the middle is stationed on
the USS Truman. The Truman hasn't come anywhere near Deep Space Nine in
months. <br>
JORAN: Pity. Keep looking.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JORAN: Greta was quite a packrat, wasn't she? <br>
EZRI: She was here a long time. This was home. <br>
JORAN: A monument to bad taste. Just an observation. <br>
(A holopicture of the laughing bride in her husband's arms.) <br>
EZRI: Vanderweg's husband is a micropaleontologist on Mora Five. She
was married, Ilario was single. She was on Deep Space Nine for three
years, he just got here. She was a mature woman, he was practically a
kid. Besides the uniform, they had absolutely nothing in common. Which
means they could have just been chosen at random. And if that's the
case, then we're wasting our time. </font></p>

<br>
EZRI: I didn't say that. <br>
JORAN: You don't have to. You have failure written all over you. <br>
EZRI: I'm sorry to disappoint you. <br>
JORAN: It's not the lack of clues that's keeping you from finding the
killer, it's you. <br>
EZRI: Me? <br>
JORAN: You're holding back, Ezri. You refuse to see with his eyes, feel
with his hands, think with his mind. <br>
EZRI: You want to turn me into a killer, make me like you. <br>
JORAN: You are me. <br>
EZRI: You want me to kill someone? What do you say I start with you. <br>
JORAN: That's the spirit. <br>
SECURITY: Hold it! Stop him! <br>
(Upstairs, a Starfleet officer is being chased by Bajoran security.) <br>
EZRI: They've found him! <br>
SECURITY: Stop that man! <br>
(The man runs down the stairs. Ezri kicks a chair over to slow him up
and then throws him to the floor. The man hits her.) <br>
JORAN: A weapon. Over there. (Ezri picks up a knife.) Yes. Yes, do it.
Do it! <br>
(But Odo takes the knife from her.) <br>
ODO: That's enough! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: You mind explaining this? I'm told that if
Odo hadn't stopped you, you'd have stabbed Ensign Bertram. <br>
EZRI: I was trying to stop him from getting away, all right? He hit me,
I reacted. I guess I overreacted. <br>
SISKO: I'd say so. <br>
JORAN: He could be a little more appreciative, don't you think? <br>
EZRI: I'm sorry things get out of hand, but Bertram killed two people. <br>
SISKO: Bertram didn't kill anyone. <br>
EZRI: Then why was the Security team chasing him? <br>
SISKO: Because a month ago, he accessed the replicator patterns on TR
one one six without authorisation. <br>
JORAN: Sounds guilty to me. <br>
EZRI: Why would he replicate a rifle unless he was going to use it? <br>
SISKO: Because he collects weapons. Federation, Klingon, and
Cardassian. <br>
JORAN: What a coincidence. <br>
EZRI: That doesn't rule him out as a suspect. <br>
SISKO: True. But the fact that he was on Bajor when the first murder
occurred does. You've been under a lot of stress lately, so <br>
EZRI: Ben, please don't give up on me. I can find this murderer. I know
I can. I just need more time.

all see in that man. He's so insufferable, so Starfleet. I'm surprised
the killer hasn't targeted him. I'm joking of course. But he did come
perilously close to derailing our investigation.

me. <br>
EZRI: You're kidding. One word about you and he'd have pulled me off
the case. <br>
JORAN: Well then, I guess I'll have to remain your little secret and be
glad that you're still in his good graces. Not that it matters, really.

BASHIR: Captain. <br>
SISKO: The bullet pierced his heart? <br>
BASHIR: At close range. <br>
JORAN: Why am I not surprised. <br>
(Later, Ezri is alone searching the room.) <br>
JORAN: What happens if we don't catch him? Will he keep shooting
Starfleet officers till there are none left on the station? How could
anyone be so happy with such unattractive children? <br>

Pictures of laughing faces. <br>
JORAN: A killer who hates laughter. Who hates emotion. <br>
EZRI: A Vulcan. <br>
JORAN: All Vulcans distrust emotions, but they don't go around killing
people for smiling. <br>
EZRI: This one does. Something happened to him, something so
emotionally painful it's making him lose control. When he looks through
the targeting sensor and sees those pictures, the laughter seems to
mock him. <br>
JORAN: You're thinking like he thinks. Good, Ezri. <br>
EZRI: Computer. How many Vulcan Starfleet Officers are on the station? <br>
COMPUTER: There are forty eight Vulcans serving on Deep Space Nine. <br>
JORAN: Now all we have to do is eliminate forty seven of them. <br>
EZRI: I should tell Odo. <br>
JORAN: Not until we have proof. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There are Vulcans seemingly everywhere.) <br>
EZRI: There's one thing I don't understand. If he hates laughter, then
why doesn't he seek out his victims in Quark's or in a holosuite? <br>
JORAN: Maybe it's not just the laughter. <br>
EZRI: You're right. Maybe it has something to do with the way the
photograph freezes the emotion, making it seem like the laughter is
going to last forever. </font></p>

Ricktor Prime. He was one of only six crewmen to survive. <br>
JORAN: Six survivors out of a crew of twelve hundred and fifty. <br>
EZRI: He served on that ship for ten years. Those people who were
killed were his colleagues, his friends. <br>
