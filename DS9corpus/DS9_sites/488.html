WORF: Department heads, prepare reports for tomorrow's briefing. All
hands, dismissed. <br>
DAX: I'd say that was successful mission. Five days in the Gamma
quadrant and no sign of the Jem'Hadar. <br>
WORF: Commander, during our manoeuvres through that asteroid belt in
the Kar-telos system, I noticed the Defiant felt a little sluggish when
turning hard aport. <br>
DAX: The inertial dampening generators may need to be realigned. <br>
WORF: I'll begin drawing up a schedule immediately. And while we're at
it, we should recalibrate the targeting scanners and check the EPS
relays. <br>
DAX: O'Brien's going to be a little disappointed. He thought he finally
had the ship running smoothly. <br>
WORF: Chief O'Brien has done an excellent job. This is a fine ship. But
it is my duty to keep her functioning at peak proficiency. <br>
DAX: Mister Worf, you're in love. With the Defiant. <br>
WORF: You exaggerate, as usual. </font></p>

O'BRIEN: There, you see. Your public has spoken. <br>
LEETA: Have fun. <br>
BASHIR: What do you call this holosuite programme of yours called
again? <br>
O'BRIEN: The Battle of Clontarf. You and me and a thousand stalwart
Irish warriors against a ravening hoard of Vikings. It's like the
Battle of Britain, only with swords. <br>
BASHIR: How come you get to be the High King? <br>
O'BRIEN: I am a direct descendant of King Brian Boru. Besides, it's my
programme. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose that's only fair. <br>

play. Rom is whining whilst mixing a drink.) <br>
QUARK: I know exactly how you feel. The Bajoran Time of Cleansing.
Could someone explain to me why the Bajorans need to abstain from
worldly pleasures for an entire month? I mean, it's not like they're a
bunch of hedonistic holosuite-obsessed drunkards to begin with. (Rom
groans) No use moaning about it. <br>

ROM: Me. It's one of Moogie's home remedies. <br>

starting to spin.) <br>
QUARK: Just because you happen to be intimately acquainted with Doctor
Bashir's bedside manner doesn't make you a medical expert. <br>

LEETA: What I do during my time off is no business of yours. <br>
QUARK: If you don't get back to work this instant, you're going to have
more time off than you know what to do with. The same goes for you.
Here. <br>

BASHIR: This is one stubborn infection. How long have you had it? <br>
ROM: A couple of weeks. <br>
BASHIR: You mean to tell me you've been walking around with a seeping
infection of the tympanic membrane for two weeks? <br>
ROM: More like three, actually. <br>
BASHIR: Rom, you could have died! Another forty eight hours and you'd
have been bidding for a new life in the Divine Treasury. <br>
ROM: I guess it's a good thing I fainted when I did. <br>
BASHIR: Why didn't you come and see me sooner? <br>
ROM: I couldn't. I was busy. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure your brother could have spared you for half an hour. <br>
ROM: It would've been a violation of my contract. Paragraph seventy
six, subsection three. Employees of Quark's Bar and Holding Company are
strictly prohibited from leaving the work environment during business
hours unless ordered to do so by their employer. Any failure to comply
with this provision will result in severe fines and possible dismissal.
It's a standard provision in all Ferengi labour contracts. <br>
BASHIR: You mean you don't get time off even if you're sick? <br>
ROM: It's all part of our generous employee compensation package. No
sick days, no vacations, no paid overtime. <br>
BASHIR: It sounds to me like you need a better contract. <br>
ROM: There's no such thing. All Ferengi labour contracts are the same. <br>
BASHIR: Well, that should do it. But I want you to see me first thing
in the morning for a follow-up. <br>
ROM: It'll have to be before the bar opens. <br>
BASHIR: What you people need is a union. <br>
ROM: A what? <br>
BASHIR: You know, a trade guild, a collective bargaining association. A
union. Something to keep you from being exploited. <br>
ROM: You don't understand. Ferengi workers don't want to stop the
exploitation. We want to find a way to become the exploiters. <br>
BASHIR: Suit yourself. But I don't see you exploiting anyone.

LEETA: Julian's a wonderful doctor. Your brother should have let you
see him weeks ago. <br>
ROM: It's not Quark's fault that I got sick. I forgot to get my
bimonthly ear scan. And besides, I've probably been getting too much
oo-mox. <br>

LEETA: (sotto) What now? <br>
QUARK: I have an announcement to make. I've just been going over
today's receipts and it's not good. The only thing this Bajoran
Cleansing Ritual has cleansed is my profit margin. So, starting
tomorrow, everyone's salary gets cut by a third. <br>

LEETA: It's ridiculous. <br>
QUARK: It was either that or fire half the staff. Don't bother thanking

LEETA: I can't afford a pay cut. <br>
QUARK: It's either a pay cut or a layoff. You decide. All right
everyone, get back to work. I want this place cleaned up and the lights
off in ten minutes. <br>
ROM: Brother, this isn't right. You can't just cut people's salaries
without warning. <br>
QUARK: Actually, I can. And I have. Now why don't you concentrate on
keeping your hands off your lobes and leave the business matters to me.
<br>
ROM: But once the Cleansing Ritual is over you'll restore everyone's
salary, right? <br>
QUARK: That depends on next quarter's fiscal summation. <br>
ROM: Brother, I'm asking you as a personal favour to reconsider this
pay cut. <br>
QUARK: Anything for you. (thinks) There. I've reconsidered it. My
decision stands. <br>
ROM: But, brother <br>
QUARK: Don't brother me. In this bar you're not my brother. You're my
employee. And employees have no right to question the management's
decisions. <br>
ROM: I'm warning you, if you don't rescind the pay cuts you're going to
regret it. <br>
QUARK: The only thing I regret is not being an only child.

ODO: I know these incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but
if security breaches like these could happen on the flagship of the
Federation, imagine the difficulty of maintaining security at an open

that's proven unpopular with the staff. But I'm not going to do that
today. <br>
GRIMP: You're not? <br>
ROM: No. I'm not. Quark's just using the Cleansing Ritual to increase
his profits at our expense. It isn't fair, and we're not going to take

FROOL: The Ferengi Commerce Authority doesn't have to hear about this.
If we all go back to work now, no one else has to know this ever
happened. <br>
GRIMP: No, no, it's too late for that. The FCA has ears everywhere. And
as soon as their lobes get wind of this, we're all doomed. <br>

for the rest of our lives. But I say if they're going to come after us,
let's give them a good reason. Every one of you, Ferengi and
non-Ferengi alike, knows that the way Quark treats us is unfair. Frool,
don't you deserve a day off when your back starts acting up? <br>

Eleven months those mines were closed, and they didn't open again until
all the miners' demands were met. <br>
ROM: You mean we should force Quark to close the bar? <br>
BASHIR: Only as a last resort. If he's reasonable about your requests,
there's no need to strike. <br>

words. And when you do, you'll have to be strong. <br>

western Pennsylvania. <br>

the strike ended. Thirty two bullets he had in him. Or was it thirty
four? <br>

O'BRIEN: That's the problem when you combine Cardassian, Bajoran and
Federation technology. None of it was meant to work together. <br>
WORF: How do you tolerate working in this environment? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a lot easier than working on the Enterprise. <br>
WORF: Easier? The Enterprise never had these kind of problems. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Captain, believe me, I want this strike
settled as much as you do. <br>
SISKO: Then settle it. <br>
QUARK: It's not that simple. <br>
SISKO: Make it simple. Sit down with your brother and hammer out an
agreement today. <br>
QUARK: Captain, I'm afraid you don't understand what a delicate
situation this is. Even talking with strikers would be a violation of
the most sacred precepts of Ferengi culture. <br>
SISKO: Maybe I don't know much about Ferengi culture but I do know who
holds the lease on your bar. <br>
QUARK: The Federation. And I couldn't ask for better landlords. <br>
SISKO: That's because we don't ask you to pay your rent, or to
reimburse us for your maintenance repairs, or the drain on the
station's power supply. <br>
QUARK: You're a very generous people. <br>
SISKO: Until today. Let's see. Five years of back rent, plus power
consumption, plus the repairs. Do you know how much latinum that is? <br>
QUARK: A lot. <br>
SISKO: That's right. <br>
QUARK: I'll talk to my brother. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad we're in agreement. </font></p>

ROM: Come in. <br>
(Quark enters) <br>
ROM: What do you want? <br>
QUARK: Here. <br>
(Quark hands Rom a PADD) <br>
ROM: What's this? <br>
QUARK: It's the amount of latinum I'm willing to transfer into your
private account if you'll just end this strike. <br>
ROM: Are we talking about slips, strips, or bars? <br>
QUARK: Slips. All right, strips. <br>
ROM: It wouldn't matter if it were bars. I'm not going to end the
strike unless you meet our demands. <br>
QUARK: Rom, we shouldn't be fighting. We're brothers. <br>
ROM: Not when it comes to business. We're nothing but employer and
employee. You said so yourself. <br>
QUARK: I was wrong. <br>
ROM: No, you weren't. <br>
QUARK: Rom, can't we talk about this? <br>
ROM: There's only one thing I have to say to you. (reading) Workers of
the world, unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains. <br>
QUARK: What's happened to you?

BRUNT: Ah. It's about time you got back. <br>
QUARK: Brunt. <br>
BRUNT: That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. <br>
(Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) <br>
QUARK: Who could forget. What do you want? <br>
BRUNT: Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce
Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of
yours. <br>
QUARK: How do you propose to do that? <br>
BRUNT: By any means necessary. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Rom's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FROOL: I hear Quark had only fourteen customers all
day. <br>
LEETA: And he'll have even less tomorrow. I've been talking to people
all over the station and support for our cause is growing. <br>
FROOL: Quark will have to settle. Either that or go out of business. <br>
GRIMP: I don't know. Quark can be awful stubborn. I think he'd rather
lose the bar than give in to us. <br>
ROM: Don't be such a pessimist. Remember Rule of Acquisition two sixty
three. Never allow doubt to tarnish your lust for latinum. <br>
GRIMP: Your brother can quote the Rules of Acquisition, too. I think
his favourite is two eleven. Employees are the rungs on the Ladder of
Success. Don't hesitate to step on them. <br>
ROM: My ex-brother wasn't quoting the Rules of Acquisition when he came
to see me yesterday. <br>
LEETA: What did he say? <br>
ROM: He offered me a bribe if I would end the strike. <br>
GRIMP: Did you take it? <br>
ROM: No, I didn't take it. Don't you see what that means? He's getting
desperate. A few more days and we'll get everything we want. <br>
(The door is opened by someone phasering the lock.) <br>
BRUNT: Brunt, FCA. <br>
FROOL: It's not my fault. They made me do it. It was all his idea.
Forgive me. <br>
(Frool falls to his knees.) <br>
BRUNT: If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of
the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace
below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where
you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch
for gree-worms. <br>
FROOL: Spare me. I'm old, I'm fragile. I'll push the rest of them off
myself. <br>
GRIMP: I thought you said you weren't afraid of the FCA. <br>
FROOL: I lied. <br>
ROM: Don't let him intimidate you. We're not on Ferenginar. <br>
BRUNT: Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this
station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've
been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted
values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to
forgive. <br>
FROOL: Really? <br>
BRUNT: But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back
at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar
will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits
revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I
understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. <br>
(Brunt and Co leave) <br>
GRIMP: Would you get up? Come on. <br>
ROM: Let him stay there. That's where he belongs. The question is,
where do we belong? On our knees, like Frool, or standing tall like
Sean O'Brien? <br>
LEETA: Who's Sean O'Brien? <br>
ROM: He was a union man. A man who gave his life to earn a decent wage
for his fellow workers. Brunt wouldn't have intimidated him, and he
won't intimidate me. <br>
GRIMP: What about our accounts on Ferenginar? <br>
ROM: If your accounts on Ferenginar were worth anything, you wouldn't
be working as a waiter. I'm telling you, nothing has changed. Victory
is within our grasp. All we have to do is take it. Now are you with me?
<br>
GRIMP + LEETA: Yes. <br>
ROM: I said, are you with me! <br>
ALL: Yes! <br>
ROM: Then let's get back on that picket line and show Quark what we're
made of. <br>
ALL: Yeah! <br>

WORF: Chief, may I speak with you? <br>
O'BRIEN: Sure. What's on your mind? <br>
WORF: I feel I owe you an apology. I allowed our argument in Quark's to
get out of hand. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think there was plenty of blame to spread around. <br>
WORF: Nonetheless, we are Starfleet officers, and Starfleet officers do
not brawl with each other. <br>
O'BRIEN: It wasn't much of a brawl, really. I grabbed you, you shoved
me, and Julian was tossed over a table. <br>
WORF: It never should have happened. And under normal circumstances, it
never would have. But there is something about this station I find
unsettling. <br>
O'BRIEN: You'll get used to it. <br>
WORF: Perhaps. But in the meantime, I think I've found a solution. I'm
going to move my quarters to the Defiant. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're going to live on the Defiant? <br>
WORF: I have already discussed it with Captain Sisko. <br>
O'BRIEN: And he said yes? <br>
WORF: As long as it doesn't interfere with my duties. <br>
O'BRIEN: But you'll be living out there all by yourself. <br>

Brunt the way you did. <br>
ROM: Who'd have thought I had such natural leadership skills? <br>
LEETA: I knew it all along. <br>

LEETA: No. <br>
ROM: I didn't think so. <br>
LEETA: Well, you surprised a lot of people, including me. I've got to
get ready. I'm having dinner with Julian. <br>

LEETA: And almost as brave as you are. <br>
(Leeta kisses Rom's forehead and goes into her quarters. Quark appears
from around the corner.) <br>
QUARK: Psst! Rom! <br>

QUARK: There's no accounting for taste. Rom, we have to talk. <br>
ROM: Are you ready to give in to our demands? <br>
QUARK: Of course not. <br>
ROM: Then there's nothing to talk about. <br>
QUARK: There's plenty to talk about. The FCA's involved now, and those
Nausicaans working for Brunt aren't just for show. <br>
ROM: I'm not going to let Brunt intimidate me. <br>
QUARK: Don't you see, Rom? You should be intimidated. There's no
telling what Brunt might do, and I don't want you to get hurt. <br>
ROM: You never cared what happened to me before. <br>
(Quark slams Rom up against a bulkhead.) <br>
QUARK: I always cared about you. I tried to protect you, save you from
yourself. <br>
ROM: How? By telling me I was an idiot my whole life? <br>
QUARK: I had to be tough on you. I was trying to make you a better
Ferengi. <br>
ROM: What you were trying to do was make yourself feel important.
Making me feel dumb made you feel smart. But I'm not dumb and you're
not half as smart as you think you are. <br>
QUARK: Rom! You have to listen to me! The FCA doesn't have to answer to
anyone, and if Brunt decides to get rid of you I won't be able to stop
him. <br>
ROM: Look at it this way. If Brunt gets rid of me, then all your
problems are solved. You always said you wanted to be an only child.

BRUNT: I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did
you talk to your brother? <br>
QUARK: We talked. <br>
BRUNT: And? <br>
QUARK: I need more time. <br>
BRUNT: Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. <br>
QUARK: Look, you're here to help me, right? <br>
BRUNT: Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi
traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are
going to have to make an example of someone. <br>
QUARK: What kind of example? <br>
BRUNT: Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get
people's attention. <br>
QUARK: I don't want my brother hurt. <br>
BRUNT: I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you
risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be
someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. <br>
QUARK: Leeta? But she's not even Ferengi. <br>
BRUNT: I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such
delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order.
Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. <br>
(The Nausicaans come over.) <br>
QUARK: Me? But I'm on your side. <br>

QUARK: It's nothing to smile about. Those Nausicaans shattered my left
eye socket, broke two of my ascending ribs and punctured my lower lung.

now. <br>
ROM: I'm not done gloating. <br>
QUARK: Don't you get it? This was a message for you. <br>
ROM: It's not going to work. <br>
QUARK: I wish Brunt had known that. <br>
ROM: Odo has him and the Nausicaans in a holding cell. He says it's an
open and shut case. <br>
QUARK: It's an open and shut case all right, but I'm not going to press
charges. <br>
ROM: You're not? <br>
QUARK: Of course not. I'm in enough trouble with the FCA as it is. <br>
ROM: But then Odo will have to let them go. <br>
QUARK: Either way, the FCA will just send another Liquidator. And that
one will make an example of you. <br>
ROM: Then you'll be the one gloating. <br>
QUARK: I don't want to gloat. I want to end the strike. <br>
ROM: So give us what we want. <br>
QUARK: Rom, I can't. I'm not going against ten thousand years of
Ferengi tradition. <br>
ROM: You're just afraid of the FCA. <br>
QUARK: Of course I'm afraid of the FCA. They crushed my eye socket. And
if you had any sense, you'd be afraid of them too. If this strike
doesn't get settled soon, we're both going to find ourselves tossed out
of the nearest airlock. You have to dissolve the union. (idea) At least
officially. <br>
ROM: What do you mean? <br>
QUARK: I mean, I mean you dissolve the union, make it look like I've
won, and I'll give you everything you want. <br>
ROM: You'll meet our demands? <br>
QUARK: That's what I just said, you idiot. <br>
ROM: Even sick leave? <br>
QUARK: Even sick leave. And six months from now, when the FCA isn't
watching my books so closely, you'll get your raises. <br>
ROM: Six months! <br>
QUARK: It's the best I can do. <br>
ROM: No, it's not. All you have to do is make up one of your fake
business ledgers for the FCA. They'll never know the difference. <br>
QUARK: Shush! All right, you'll get your raises by the end of the week.
But the union dies here. Today. And that's my final offer.
