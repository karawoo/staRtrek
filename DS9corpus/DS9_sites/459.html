LEANNE: I came back early. You know, I was just thinking about you. <br>
JAKE: Really? <br>
LEANNE: Yeah. I passed by the Klingon restaurant and I was thinking
about the time you and I and Orak were eating dinner <br>

cancelling them. <br>
LEANNE: Really? If you do cancel, would you be interested in dinner? <br>
JAKE: Sure. <br>
LEANNE: Great. How about eighteen hundred at the Klingon restaurant? <br>

WINN: Thank you. Vedek Bareil and I were on our way to a secret meeting
with a member of the Cardassian Central Command. It was my intention to
open talks between Bajor and Cardassia that would lead to a treaty and
to a final peace settlement. <br>
SISKO: You have been negotiating peace with Cardassia? <br>
WINN: The Prophets teach us that while violence may keep an enemy at
bay, only peace can make him a friend. <br>
SISKO: How long has this been going on? <br>
WINN: Vedek Bareil has been working to set up this meeting with Legate
Turrel for the past five months. They've discussed issues ranging from
war reparations to the exchange of ambassadors. There's even the
possibility that the Cardassians will issue a formal apology for the
pain and suffering inflicted on the Bajoran people during the
occupation. I was on my way to our first face-to-face meeting when we
had the accident. <br>
SISKO: Please, don't take this the wrong way, but I never would've
guessed that you would be the one to bring such a bold vision of peace
to Bajor. <br>
WINN: A large share of the credit goes to Vedek Bareil. Without him,
the talks could have never come this far. <br>
SISKO: It sounds like you've developed a deeper appreciation for Vedek
Bareil. <br>
WINN: I must admit he has been a loyal and trustworthy aide since the
election. I'm not sure I could have been as forgiving if I'd been in
his place. These talks were Bareil's idea. He's guided me through them,
and without him in the future, these talks may never resume.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I'm sorry. The radiation severely damaged
his neural pathways. I did everything I could. <br>
KIRA: I know you did. Did he ever regain consciousness? <br>
BASHIR: No. I don't think he suffered. <br>
KIRA: Thank you, Doctor. I'm on duty in Ops. Excuse me. <br>
BASHIR: Kira. I think they can get along without you in Ops today. <br>
KIRA: Maybe, but I need to be there. I appreciate your concern but I'll
grieve in my own way in my own time.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Operating theatre]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NURSE: We're ready to begin the autopsy, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Release the stasis field. Let's begin with a neural scan. I
want to map his central axonal pathways, find out where the breakdown
began. <br>
NURSE: Shall I begin taking neural tissue samples? <br>
BASHIR: Looks like the damage began in the parietal lobe, spread
through the rest of the brain in a retrograde manner. <br>
(Something flashes on the screen) <br>
BASHIR: Wait a minute. A neuron just fired in his cerebral cortex.
There it is again. His nerves. His nerves are still transmitting
electrical impulses to his brain <br>
NURSE: How can that be? His brain activity level is zero. His nervous
system should be completely inactive. <br>
BASHIR: I don't know but it means his body's still capable of sending
messages to the brain, even though the brain can't process them. The
radiation he was exposed to might have fortified his peripheral cell
membranes. If we can regenerate his pathways with his own neuron cells,
we might be able to revive him. <br>
NURSE: What about brain damage? There's been no oxygen to his brain for
almost forty minutes. <br>
BASHIR: But he's been in stasis for most of that time. That, combined
with the strengthening of his cell membranes might buy us the time we
need. <br>
(Later) <br>
BASHIR: We'll have to direct a burst of electrical energy into his
cerebral cortex. If the burst is the proper intensity, it should create
a cascade effect within the brain and the neurons might resume their
normal firing pattern. Okay. Let's close up the cranial cavity. <br>
(Later) <br>
BASHIR: The neurogenic stimulator is in place. Let's try a fifty
millivolt burst. <br>
(Twitch) <br>
BASHIR: Increase it to sixty. <br>
(Twitch) <br>
BASHIR: Seventy. <br>
NURSE: That's five millivolts above what normal tissue can withstand.
It'll burn out his cerebral cortex. <br>
BASHIR: If I'm right, the inaprovaline drug I gave him should provide
additional resistance against the excess electro-stimulation. Seventy. <br>
(Jerk, gasp.) <br>
NURSE: Doctor! <br>
(Bareil opens his eyes.) <br>
(Later, Winn, Sisko and Kira are by Bareil's bed.) <br>
BASHIR: Well, it's a little early to tell, but I'm hoping he'll make a
full recovery. He should be back on his feet again in a few weeks. <br>
SISKO: You say that so calmly, but it's not every doctor that can lose
a patient and then has him back on his feet in a few weeks. <br>
WINN: Indeed, you are too modest. You've performed nothing less than a
miracle here. The Prophets must walk with you, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I and the Prophets, were lucky that the ionising
radiation left a residual signature on Bareil's axonal pathways. That's
what really made this possible. <br>
BAREIL: Whoever deserves the credit, Doctor, I am grateful. <br>
WINN: And I am grateful you were not taken from us, Vedek Bareil. <br>
BAREIL: My work here is not yet finished. <br>
WINN: No, it is not. We must resume the negotiations immediately. We
can't risk losing the momentum we've established. I would like to send
a coded message to Legate Turrel and invite him to come to DS Nine to
continue the talks. <br>
BASHIR: Wait a minute. Bareil's in no condition to conduct
negotiations. <br>
WINN: Bareil will simply be advising me. I will conduct the actual
talks. <br>
BASHIR: I'll allow it as long as your visits don't tire him. <br>
WINN: Agreed. Vedek, we will talk again soon. <br>
BAREIL: Eminence. <br>

Cardassians returning the Orbs
until diplomatic relations have been established. <br>
WINN: That would only delay an inevitable argument. <br>
BAREIL: But it will give the peace process a chance to grow. Once the
Cardassians are invested in the process, it may be easier to discuss
these matters. <br>
WINN: Very well. <br>
BAREIL: A wise decision, Eminence. <br>
WINN: I hope so, Vedek Bareil. The first meeting with Turrel is
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. I will see you again before then. <br>
(Winn leaves) <br>
BAREIL: I take it you're not here to deliver a good report, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: In order to revive you, I had to flood your nervous system with
neurogenic radiation. Unfortunately, this has caused some kind of
selective vaso-constriction of your arteries. The result is an
inadequate blood flow to your internal organs. <br>
BAREIL: So what do we do? <br>
BASHIR: We'd like to place you back into stasis, do some research on
your condition. <br>
BAREIL: For how long? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know yet. Days, weeks even months. <br>
BAREIL: Maybe even years? <br>
BASHIR: Maybe. <br>
BAREIL: I'm sorry, Doctor, that's not acceptable. I can't allow myself
to be put in storage when my people need me. I don't want to wake to a
Bajor still haunted by the memory of the occupation. <br>
BASHIR: I realize how important these talks are to Bajor, but as your
physician my duty is to you first. <br>
BAREIL: And I have a duty to Bajor. Please, help me heal my people.
It's the only thing that matters to me. <br>
BASHIR: There is an experimental drug called Vasokin which would
increase the blood flow to your organs and might enable you to function
normally for a while. But there is a great deal of risk attached. <br>
BAREIL: What sort of risk? <br>
BASHIR: In twenty two percent of cases, Vasokin has severely damaged
the patient's lungs, kidneys, even heart. Sometimes the brain. In your
condition, it could even be fatal. <br>
BAREIL: But it would allow me to function normally for the next few
days? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. But why risk your life for a few days? <br>
BAREIL: I have no great desire to die, Doctor, but I am determined to
carry out the will of the Prophets as long as I am able, and I cannot
carry out their will if I am unconscious in some stasis tube. Please,
begin the Vasokin treatment. <br>
BASHIR: All right. We'll start this afternoon. I only hope we don't
regret this. <br>

Bajoran prisoners left in Cardassian hands. <br>
SISKO: Maybe we should redefine our terms. Perhaps there are no
official prisoners but are there be a number of, shall we say,
detainees? <br>
TURREL: There are, of course, people being detained at the Justice
Ministry for crimes against the state, but that is a discussion for
another time. Now, I would like to discuss what you've called war
reparations. We would be willing to pay for the destruction of all
Bajoran property incurred during the occupation as long as you would be
willing to return to us all Cardassian property and equipment left
behind on Bajor. <br>
WINN: What sort of property? <br>
TURREL: I can provide you with lists of material, equipment, as long as
we have an agreement in principle that anything of Cardassian origin

respects him. I think he even likes him. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid you may have to face the possibility that Bareil may
not be able to help you much longer. <br>

JAKE: You should've seen the way he acted, Dad. He was acting like a
spoiled brat. I've never been so embarrassed. I don't think Leanne will
ever speak to me again. <br>
SISKO: So what did he do? <br>
JAKE: All kinds of stupid things. Riska couldn't even say two words
without him telling her to be quiet. And he insisted that she cut up
his food for him. He was treating her like she was some kind of slave. <br>
SISKO: Sounds like he's acting like a Ferengi to me. You can't blame
him for that. <br>
JAKE: Well, in that case, maybe you were right all along. <br>
SISKO: About what? <br>
JAKE: You once said that Humans and Ferengis are too different to ever
really be friends. <br>
SISKO: I remember saying that. And you know what? I was wrong. You and
Nog proved that. Sure, you have your cultural differences, but there's
a real bond between you. <br>
JAKE: Well, I know one thing. I'm never going to set him up on a date
again. <br>
SISKO: I think you two should talk this over before it becomes too big
a problem. <br>
JAKE: I'm not sure Nog is going to be willing to talk to me so soon. <br>
SISKO: Well, I guess you'll have to do something to get his attention.

runs in.) <br>
BASHIR: What happened? <br>
NURSE: I don't know. <br>
BASHIR: Two cc's morphenolog. It's all right, it's all right. You're
getting help. You're getting help. I thought I made it clear there were
to be no visitors for the next three hours. <br>
WINN: It's not her fault, Doctor. Bareil called me himself. He said he
had some ideas on the treaty. <br>
BASHIR: And you just couldn't wait to hear them, could you. His left
temporal lobe is showing signs of massive synaptic failure. Well, I
hope you got all the advice you needed, Eminence, because the Vasokin
has damaged his brain and that damage is irreversible.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Will he regain consciousness? <br>
BASHIR: Not in his present condition. <br>
WINN: You were able to replace some of his internal organs with
artificial implants. Could you do something similar with the damaged
parts of his brain? <br>
BASHIR: It's hard to say with any certainty. There's still a great deal
about the way the brain operates we don't understand. One of my
professors at medical school used to say that the brain had a spark of
life that can't be replicated. If we begin to replace parts of Bareil's
brain with artificial implants, that spark may be lost. <br>
KIRA: But you're saying if we don't do it, Bareil will never regain
consciousness and he'll die.<br>
SISKO: I think we need to consider what Bareil would want us to do. <br>
WINN: Vedek Bareil wanted these negotiations to be completed, no matter
what the cost. <br>
BASHIR: With all due respect, your Eminence, you're hardly an impartial
observer here. You have a personal interest in these talks. <br>
WINN: There is more at stake than one man's life. <br>
BASHIR: One man's life is all I'm concerned with at the moment. <br>
KIRA: I think she's right, Julian. I think Bareil would want the
positronic implants. <br>
BASHIR: Kira, if I go through with this, the man who wakes up may not
be the man you used to know. <br>
KIRA: I realise that, but I know how important this is to him, and I
know he wouldn't want to just be put into stasis indefinitely, waiting
for some medical solution that may never come. Do the surgery, Julian.
Let him finish what he started. </font></p>

ODO: As if you didn't know. Your accomplice here has also denied

BAREIL: It's hard to explain, but when you touch me, it doesn't seem

JAKE: No kidding. <br>
NOG: That's not what I mean. My father told me that if I got caught
stealing again, he would send me back to live on the Ferengi homeworld
with my grandmother. So where is he? Why isn't he here yelling and
threatening me? And where's Uncle Quark? I'm late for work. And come to
think of it, what are you doing here? <br>
JAKE: Ask Odo. <br>
NOG: No, no, no. Throwing you in here wasn't Odo's idea. You don't just
arrest the station commander's son without some really strong evidence.
And I know there is no evidence because I know we didn't do anything.
So why are we in here, Jake? <br>
JAKE: All right. I put Odo up to this because I wanted to talk to you. <br>
NOG: In here? <br>
JAKE: I didn't think you'd listen to me otherwise. <br>
NOG: Well, this better be good. <br>
JAKE: I wanted to say I'm sorry. I guess I just forgot you're a
Ferengi. <br>
NOG: You forgot? To most people, the lobes are a dead giveaway. <br>
JAKE: What I mean is, we spend so much time together and we seem so
much alike, I sometimes forget we're different. <br>
NOG: I know we're different. I mean, anyone who talks to a female with
fawning respect is no Ferengi. It made me sick. <br>
JAKE: You want to talk about sick? Sick is making Riska cut up your
food for you. <br>
NOG: At least I didn't have her chew. <br>
JAKE: Chew it? <br>
NOG: That's right. In traditional Ferengi homes, the females soften the
food with her teeth before they give it to the males. <br>
JAKE: That is disgusting. <br>
NOG: I knew you would react that way, which is why I didn't have her do
it. <br>
JAKE: Well, do you have any other disgusting Ferengi customs I should
know about? <br>
NOG: Plenty. And I know plenty of human customs that disgust me. <br>
JAKE: Great. So we both disgust each other. You know, as we get older,
this is just going to get worse. But I know one thing. I don't want to
lose you as a friend. <br>
NOG: Well, in that case, double-dating is definitely out. <br>
JAKE: Agreed. And I guess we'll just have to deal with the rest of our
disgusting habits as they come up. <br>
NOG: I guess so. You feel better? <br>
JAKE: Yeah. <br>
NOG: Good. Now can we get out of here? <br>
JAKE: Sure. Odo? Odo? He's just playing around. Odo!

that Legate Turrel has signed the peace treaty. The news has sent a

looks as though they're finally willing to put their long conflict

won't be Bareil. The spark of life will be gone. He'll be dead. And
I'll be the one who killed him. <br>
KIRA: But if we do nothing he'll die. <br>
BASHIR: That's right, he will. But he'll die like a man, not a machine.
Please, don't make me fight you on this one. Just let him go. <br>

KIRA: You got your treaty. I just wish we'd had more time for us.
There's so much I never told you, but this is the time we have left so
I'd better say it now. I'll never forget the first time I saw you, the
day you came to the station. You had such a serenity about you. I
thought you had all the answers. It really got on my nerves for a
while. But then I got to know you and I realised you were just as
confused as the rest of us. You just accepted your confusion better
than anyone I've ever known. That's when I realised I loved you. </font>
