<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's a very busy day, and Quark can't keep up.) <br>
WOMAN: Can I have some service please? How long does it take? I've been
waiting forever. <br>
MAN: Quark, this isn't what I wanted. (storms out.) <br>
ODO: Having a bad day? <br>
QUARK: Like you care. (reads order) Fizz, froth, flip, finial, foam and
flare. What's going on at that table, anyway? <br>
ODO: I take it there's a problem with your drink replicator? <br>
(Dax enters) <br>
QUARK: A problem? No. Can't be. If there were a problem, I would have
submitted an emergency maintenance request this morning. And if I had
done that, Chief O'Brien would have assured me that Rom would fix it
right away. Then, of course, Rom would have then promised me that Nog
would fix it before the end of the day. And since this is the end of
the day and there is no Nog in sight, we can only draw one conclusion.
That I don't have a problem. <br>
DAX: Is your drink replicator broken? <br>
QUARK: You're quick today. <br>
DAX: Do you want me to fix it or not? <br>
QUARK: You? <br>
DAX: That's right. Nog had a chance to take a trip to Ferenginar and I
told him that I would cover for him while he was away. <br>
QUARK: Why? <br>
DAX: Because he did a favour for me last week, so I owe him. <br>
QUARK: But that's work for a mechanic, a repairman, a lowly engineer. <br>
DAX: I'll tell Chief O'Brien you said that. <br>
QUARK: A Supernova and a silven surprise. She can't do this. <br>
ODO: Why not? <br>
QUARK: It's not right. She's above this sort of thing. Those hands
weren't meant to be poking around inside a filthy drink replicator. <br>
(Dax pulls some green gunk out of the innards.) <br>
QUARK: They were meant for higher pursuits. <br>
ODO: You're in love. <br>
QUARK: That is the most ridiculous thing you've said this last year. <br>
ODO: Really? <br>
QUARK: Really. <br>
ODO: It must kill you that she's married to Worf. <br>
QUARK: I don't know what you're talking about. And since you're not
going to order something, would you please step aside so that I can do
my job. <br>
ODO: Of course. By the way, that's not a Silven surprise, it's a Silken
sunrise.

JAKE: Is that it? <br>
NOG: That's right. <br>
JAKE: Can I see it? <br>
NOG: No. <br>
JAKE: Nog. <br>
NOG: No. It's an official diplomatic message from the Federation
Council to the Grand Nagus. It's for his eyes only. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, but you know what's in it. <br>
NOG: Maybe. <br>
JAKE: It's a proposal for an alliance, isn't it? I mean, the Federation
sends the only Ferengi in Starfleet to personally deliver a diplomatic
message to the Grand Nagus? Something big is up. <br>
NOG: You told me you weren't coming on this trip as a reporter. <br>
JAKE: I'm not. I came to see Ferenginar. I've heard a lot about it. I
can't wait to see all the rain and the muck <br>
NOG: Good. Because while I'm delivering the message to the Grand Nagus,
you'll have plenty of time to play tourist. <br>
STARBASE [OC]: Shenandoah, this is Starbase two five seven. You've been
cleared to leave our defence perimeter. Remain at one half impulse
until you've passed the outer marker. <br>
NOG: Acknowledged. <br>
JAKE: I don't get to see the Nagus? <br>
NOG: Now why would you want to see the Nagus? <br>
JAKE: My father told me to say hello and to give the Nagus his best
wishes. <br>
NOG: You're going to have to do better than that. <br>
JAKE: And because I told the editor of the Federation News Service that
I could get an exclusive interview with Zek. <br>
NOG: Jake, you promised me you weren't coming along as a reporter! <br>
JAKE: I didn't promise, okay? I just sort of, you know. Okay, I
promised, but this could be a really big story, Nog. The people have a
right to know! <br>
NOG: Forget it. You're not getting anywhere near the Grand Nagus. I
have no further comments. <br>
(Beeping.) <br>
JAKE: What's it? <br>
NOG: I'm not sure. I'm having trouble with our long range scanners.
Looks like our sensors are being jammed. <br>
(Alarm, Red alert) <br>
NOG: Uh oh. <br>
(A squadron of Jem'Hadar fighters fly over them.) <br>
NOG: Hang on! <br>
(Evasive manoeuvres.) <br>
JAKE: Where did they come from? <br>
NOG: I don't know, but it looks like they're heading for the starbase. <br>
JAKE: We're not sticking around are we? <br>
NOG: Not in a runabout we're not. We're no match for a wing of
Jem'Hadar fighters. <br>
(So they go to warp.) <br>
NOG: See if you can open a channel to Deep Space Nine. <br>
JAKE: Something's wrong. I think they're jamming our comm. system. Now
why would they do that? <br>
NOG: Because one of them's turned around and now he's coming after us. <br>
(After the opening titles.) <br>
JAKE: You do realise you're taking us deeper and deeper into Dominion
held space. <br>
NOG: We don't have much choice. Every time I try to change course, they
gain on us. <br>
JAKE: They're gaining on us anyway. We might as well try and head for
the Federation. If we keep going in this direction, we'll run into
Cardassia Prime, and that won't be much fun at all. <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. We are within range of enemy weapons. <br>
(Boom) <br>
JAKE: Thanks for the warning. <br>
NOG: All right. When I go to impulse, raise the forward shields and
transfer auxiliary power to the phasers. <br>
JAKE: We're dropping out of warp? <br>
NOG: If we have to fight, I'd rather do it at impulse. At least we'd
have an edge in manoeuvrability. <br>
JAKE: You're a Ferengi, why don't you try making a deal or something? <br>
(Boom.) <br>
NOG: It doesn't seem they're very interested in talking. Stand by. Here
they come. <br>
(Boom, bang! The tiny runabout tries to strafe the big fighter.) <br>
JAKE: Shields down thirty percent! <br>
NOG: I see it. <br>
(Boom.) <br>
JAKE: We're losing main power! <br>
NOG: Keep the weapons online. Everything else is expendable, including
life support. <br>
JAKE: There's another ship coming in, bearing one seven zero mark two
one five. <br>
(Boom.) <br>
NOG: Jem'Hadar or Cardassian? <br>
JAKE: It's er, it's the Defiant! <br>
NOG: What? <br>
(It certainly looks like it.) <br>
NOG: It's not the Defiant. This ship's registry number is NCC seven
four two one zero. USS Valiant. <br>
(Boom.) <br>
JAKE: Valiant? Great name. I hope they tear that Jem'Hadar ship apart
piece by <br>

NOG: This is Red Squad. <br>
JAKE: Red Squad? <br>
NOG: It was a group of elite cadets at the Academy. They were the best
of the best. Red Squad received special training, special quarters,
special everything. <br>
JAKE: They have their own ship? <br>
NOG: I've heard of Cadets getting command of a runabout or a shuttle,
but not a starship. <br>
WATTERS: Fire! <br>
(Ka-BOOM! and cheers as they fly through the wreckage.) <br>
WATTERS: As you were. This is the Captain. Stand down from Red Alert.
All stations submit damage and casualty reports to the first officer.
Glad to see you made it in one piece. I'm Tim Watters, Commanding
Officer. Welcome aboard. <br>
NOG: Thank you. Sir? <br>
WATTERS: Sir, is correct, ensign. I was given a battlefield commission
and command of this vessel by the late Captain Ramirez. Using that
authority, I have commissioned and promoted other members of Red Squad
as needed. <br>
NOG: I see. Well. I'm Ensign Nog and this is Jake Sisko. We're from
Deep Space Nine. <br>
WATTERS: Sisko? You're Benjamin Sisko's son. <br>
JAKE: That's right. <br>
WATTERS: I've heard a lot about your father. I see you're not following
in his footsteps. <br>
JAKE: No. I'm a reporter. <br>
WATTERS: You should really get that looked at. Chief? <br>
COLLINS: Sir. <br>
WATTERS: Escort Mister Sisko to Sickbay. <br>
COLLINS: Aye, Captain. This way, sir. <br>
(Collins and Jake leave) <br>
FARRIS: Preliminary damage report, sir. <br>
WATTERS: Oh, thank you. Ensign Nog, Commander Karen Farris, our first
officer. <br>
NOG: Commander. <br>
FARRIS: Ensign. Sir, the Engine Room also reports that we still have
power spikes cropping up all through the deuterium injector startup
routine. <br>
WATTERS: I thought we had that under control. <br>
FARRIS: I did too, sir. <br>
NOG: Have you recalibrated the lateral impulse control system? <br>
FARRIS: No. What does that have to do with the injectors? <br>
NOG: Well, the impulse system shares some of the same power relays used
in the injector startup routine. <br>
WATTERS: We'll try it. Mister Nog, why don't you wait in my ready room.
<br>
NOG: Yes, sir. </font></p>

<br>
COLLINS: The training cruise was supposed to last three months. We had
seven regular officers and a crew of thirty five cadets. The plan was
for the cadets to run the ship while the officers observed and
critiqued our performance. <br>
JAKE: So this was a training ship. Like the other one, the, er, the
Republic. <br>
COLLINS: Not quite. The Republic's an old ship. I don't think she's
left the Terran system in fifty years. The Valiant's a state of the art
warship. Our mission was to circumnavigate the entire Federation before
returning home. <br>
JAKE: The entire Federation? With a ship of cadets? <br>
COLLINS: Not just cadets, Mister Sisko. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Valiant Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WATTERS: We were transiting the Kepla Sector when
the war broke out. As you probably know, a Dominion invasion force
swept through that sector on the first day. <br>
NOG: So you were caught behind enemy lines. <br>
WATTERS: Correct. We were trying to make our way back to Federation
held space when we encountered a Cardassian battle cruiser near El
Gatark. That was our first taste of combat. In the first fifteen
minutes, four regular officers were killed. Three others were
critically wounded including Captain Ramirez. <br>
NOG: Is that when you took command? <br>
WATTERS: No. When I got to the bridge, the Captain was in pretty bad
shape, but he was lucid and he refused to go to Sickbay. We had lost
main power and we were adrift, but the Cardassian cruiser was no better
off. So it was a race against the clock. The ship that got main power
back online first would have a decisive advantage. The Captain, he was
amazing. He directed the entire damage control effort with a punctured
lung and massive internal injuries. He was a great man. <br>
NOG: And he won the race. <br>
WATTERS: We got weapons and impulse engines back online in three hours.
And then we destroyed that Cardie ship. The next day, just before he
died, the Captain ordered me to take command of the Valiant. <br>
NOG: It's unbelievable. You've spent eight months behind enemy lines. <br>
WATTERS: I didn't do it alone. The crew deserves the real credit. We
have cadets here as young as seventeen who are doing the jobs of
officers twice their age. But we're also seriously undermanned. I could
use another officer. <br>
NOG: I'd be happy to do whatever I can, sir. <br>
WATTERS: I see you're familiar with the operations of a class seven
warp drive. <br>
NOG: Very familiar, sir. The Defiant has an identical engine. <br>
WATTERS: Excellent. As of this moment, you are Chief Engineer.
Congratulations. <br>
NOG: Chief Engineer? <br>
WATTERS: With rank of Lieutenant Commander. Your first assignment is to
figure out why we can't go above warp three point two. Mister Parton
believes it's <br>
NOG: Excuse me, sir. I, I don't think I'm ready for this. <br>
WATTERS: None of us were ready for the responsibility thrust upon us,
Commander. But each of us found a way to rise to the occasion, do the
job that had to be done. Ready or not, you are Chief Engineer. You can
do this, Mister Nog. Just have faith in yourself, faith in your
shipmates, and everything will be fine. <br>
(Nog takes the Red Squad insignia.) <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. I will, sir. <br>
WATTERS: Good man. That's what I want to hear. Now if you can just fix
our warp drive problems, we can get on with our mission. <br>
NOG: Our mission? I don't understand. <br>
WATTERS: My orders are to collect technical data on a new Dominion
battleship operating in this sector. We keep picking up their comm.
traffic, so we know they're in the area, but because we can't go faster
than warp three point two, we're unable to get within sensor range. <br>
NOG: And Starfleet knows you're in command of the Valiant. <br>
WATTERS: No. We've had to maintain strict radio silence ever since the
war began. The orders were addressed to Captain Ramirez, but since he's
dead, the mission's now mine. Make no mistake, I will carry out that
mission. Or die trying. Dismissed.

COLLINS: I haven't heard that in a long time. <br>
JAKE: I picked it up from my granddad. Of course, he still calls Luna
the moon like it's the only one or something. <br>
COLLINS: Well, nobody who's ever lived on the moon calls it Luna,
either. That's just something they say on Earth. <br>
JAKE: So what's it like? <br>
COLLINS: You're from Earth aren't you? You've never been to the moon? <br>
JAKE: Just never got around to it. Tell me about it. <br>
COLLINS: Well, people say it's so barren and harsh, but it's not. it's
beautiful. I mean Tycho City's just a city, but outside where the
gravity is still low and there's no air. You know, the sun only comes
up once a month on the moon. Every lunar morning, my father and I would
put on suits, hike out across the Sea of Clouds. We'd stop at this
collection of boulders on the western rim and just wait for the sun to
come up. Dawn is so shocking on the moon. One minute you're in the
darkest night you can imagine, and the next instant, the sun lifts up
and this glorious, pure light just explodes across the surface. I felt
like I met God every morning. (she's about to cry) I'm on duty. Excuse

<br>
NOG: Yes, sir, I do. But I also know that Chief O'Brien made the same

JAKE: That's about it. What's going on? <br>
FARRIS: What's going on, Mister Sisko, in case you haven't noticed, is
that we are in the middle of a war. We can't afford to have young
cadets thinking about mommy and daddy when they need to be
concentrating on their duties. <br>

watch the way events unfold, not participate in them. Right now, you
need to stand back. Take a look at where you are and what's going on
around you. You're right in the middle of a great story. Maybe one of
the greatest stories in the entire Dominion War. This ship is special,
Jake. This crew is special. And whatever fates guide this universe,
they've have chosen us to achieve some purpose in this conflict. I know
that. Just as surely as I know your presence on this ship is no
coincidence. You're here to write the story, to tell people of the
Valiant and her crew. Don't interfere with the story, Jake. Don't
become a part of it. Just let it unfold around you. Observe, listen,

WATTERS: Stand at ease. It's been a long eight months. A lot of hard
work, a lot of sacrifice. Now we've accomplished our mission. We found
the battleship and obtained a complete scan without being detected, and
we're free to go home. But that ship out there is a direct threat to
every Federation outpost and colony within fifty light years. That ship
must be destroyed. It can be destroyed. Commander? <br>
FARRIS: We've found a flaw in the design of their antimatter storage
system. The primary support braces are made of viterium. <br>
WATTERS: It's a very strong, very resilient metal alloy which just
happens to become extremely unstable when exposed to delta radiation. <br>
FARRIS: A single torpedo rigged with a radiogenic warhead could reduce
those braces to the consistency of wet pasta. <br>
WATTERS: And as a result, the entire antimatter storage system would
tear itself apart. Commander Nog, you don't seem convinced. <br>
NOG: Well, sir, in order to rig a torpedo to yield a delta radiation
burst I'll have to remove most of the guidance systems. We'll have to
target it manually. <br>
FARRIS: We've trained for that possibility. It shouldn't be a problem. <br>
NOG: We'll also have to get very close to the target. <br>
WATTERS: How close? <br>
NOG: Within three hundred metres. <br>
WATTERS: It's dangerous, there's no disputing that. And no one would
think any less of us if we just turn around and go home. But that means
that some other ship with some other crew would be asked to finish the
job that we started. I think we can do it. I think we should do it. <br>
JAKE: Can I say something? <br>
FARRIS: You are not a member of this crew. <br>
WATTERS: Let him speak. <br>
JAKE: You all probably know who my father is. Benjamin Sisko. So you
know I'm not exaggerating when I say that he's considered to be one of
the best combat officers in the fleet. And I'm telling you right now
that even with the entire crew of the Defiant with him, my father would
never try to pull off something like this. And if he can't do it, it
can't be done. <br>
WATTERS: We're Red Squad and we can do anything. <br>
(And the room cheers.) <br>
ALL: Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red
Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad! Red
Squad! Red Squad! </font></p>

JAKE: This is suicide. <br>
NOG: No, it's not. <br>
JAKE: Nog, listen to me. We're in way over our heads here. Now someone
told me that ship out there is twice the size of a Galaxy class
starship and three times as strong. <br>
NOG: That's accurate. <br>
JAKE: And you really think we can go up against a ship like that? <br>
NOG: I think that Captain Watters </font></p>

JAKE [on monitor]: Oh, really? Well, did you know that Watters has been
taking cordafin stimulants for the past two months? <br>
NOG [on monitor]: Where did you hear that? <br>
JAKE [on monitor]: Dorian told me. <br>
NOG [on monitor]: You were ordered to stay away from her! <br>
JAKE [on monitor]: Will you forget about obeying orders for just a
minute! <br>
WATTERS: Watters to Shepard. Please report to my Ready room,
Lieutenant. <br>

Watters is selling. <br>
NOG: He's not selling anything. He's reminding us of our duty. <br>
JAKE: I feel like I'm having a conversation with one of the bulkheads. <br>
NOG: You don't understand because you've never put on one of these
uniforms. You don't know anything about sacrifice or honour or duty or
any of the things that make up a soldier's life. I'm part of something
larger than myself. All you care about is you. <br>
JAKE: That's right. All I care about is Jake Sisko and whether or not
he's going to be killed by a bunch of delusional fanatics looking for
martyrdom. <br>
NOG: Get out. <br>
JAKE: I don't even know who you are anymore. <br>

FARRIS: They've spotted us. They're dropping out of warp. <br>

SHEPARD: Aye, sir. <br>
FARRIS: We are in visual range. <br>
WATTERS: On screen. <br>
(Thar she blows, and boy is she ugly.) <br>
WATTERS: Lay in a strafing course along their superstructure and make
it close. That way they won't get a weapons lock on us. I want to
scrape some of the paint off their hull, Lieutenant. <br>
SHEPARD: Aye, sir. <br>

down the z axis. <br>

SHEPARD: They're turning to port. <br>
WATTERS: Match them, helm. Keep us on track. <br>

COLLINS: Hull breach on deck two. Emergency forcefields are in place. <br>
FARRIS: Steady our course, helm. I can't maintain targeting lock. <br>

Ferris hits the floor. She's distracted.) <br>
WATTERS: Karen, it's all yours. Fire when ready. <br>
FARRIS: Understood. Just a little closer. <br>
SHEPARD: We're losing our port shields. <br>

reappears, solid as ever.) <br>

COLLINS: The Captain wanted us to <br>
NOG: The Captain is dead, Chief. They're all dead. The ship is lost.
There's no need for us to die here too. <br>

KIRA: Looks like it's from an escape pod. USS Valiant. <br>

a Dominion ruse to lure us into their territory. <br>

JAKE: Probably. <br>
NOG: What are you going to say? <br>
JAKE: What do you think I should say? <br>
NOG: That it was a good ship with a good crew that made a mistake. We
let ourselves blindly follow Captain Watters and he led us over a
cliff. <br>
COLLINS: That's not true. Captain Watters was a great man. <br>
JAKE: Dorian, he got everyone killed. <br>
COLLINS: If he failed it's because we failed him. <br>

themselves. <br>

NOG: He may have been a hero. He may even have been a great man. But in
the end he was a bad captain. </font> </p>
