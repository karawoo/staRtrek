with Bajoran Security, carrying boxes.) <br>
QUARK: Just set them on the bar. Morn, no touching. You know what this
is? Three cases of syrup of squill. <br>
LEETA: I love syrup of squill on my groatcakes, but I haven't seen a
jar in over a year. <br>
QUARK: No one has. <br>
ODO: Does that mean the drought on Balancar is over? <br>
QUARK: There never was a drought on Balancar. It was all a ploy by
their Agricultural Consortium. They've been stockpiling squill so they
could drive the price up. <br>
LEETA: That's dishonest. <br>
QUARK: I couldn't agree more. You see, I once did business with the
nephew of the cousin of the stepsister of a friend of the secretary to
the Consortium's chief accountant. Nephew, cousin, stepsister, friend.
Yeah, that's right. And he told me, in passing, that the accountant had
bought himself a very nice pair of Ferengi rain slippers. <br>
ODO: And if there was a drought, he wouldn't need rain slippers. <br>
QUARK: My thoughts exactly. So I set up a meeting with this accountant
and I told him that he either provide me with a shipment of syrup, or I
would expose their deception to the entire quadrant. Tomorrow morning,
we are having a special on groatcakes, topped with syrup of squill.
That is, for everyone who can afford it. What are you standing around
for? Get these crates in the storeroom. This stuff is worth its weight
in latinum. Which reminds me of another little economic episode of
mine. It happened, say, oh, eleven or twelve years ago, shortly before
I came on the station <br>
(Dax, O'Brien and Bashir enter) <br>
LEETA: Dax, Julian! You're back! I was so worried. <br>
DAX: I told you we'd be okay. <br>
LEETA: Then why all the secrecy about your mission? <br>
O'BRIEN: We weren't supposed to talk about it. <br>
BASHIR: But now it's okay. The mission's over, we've been debriefed. We
took the Defiant behind enemy lines. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're the first reconnaissance mission into Cardassian space
since the Dominion's retreat. The first one to make it back, anyway. <br>
DAX: And if that isn't reason to celebrate, I don't know what is. <br>
O'BRIEN: Three synthales. <br>
LEETA: Coming right up. <br>
ODO: Something wrong, Quark? <br>
QUARK: Yes, something's wrong. A bunch of self-satisfied Starfleet
officers just stole my audience. <br>
ODO: They're not just Starfleet officers, they're heroes. Let's face
it, Quark, there's nothing heroic about earning profit. <br>
QUARK: There is on Ferenginar. <br>
ODO: We're not on Ferenginar. <br>
(A waiter whispers to Quark.) <br>
QUARK: The Nagus calling me now? He must have found out about the
squill. I have to send him a jar. No, better make it a dozen. He loves
squill.

prisoner by the Dominion. <br>

QUARK: You mean, how do we plan on rescuing Moogie. <br>
ROM: I don't recall you saying the Nagus wanted me to go along. <br>
QUARK: Maybe he doesn't, but I do. Besides, Ishka's your mother too. <br>
ROM: And I love her. But I can't go with you. I'm a married man. I have
responsibilities. And my responsibilities don't want me to die. <br>
QUARK: I don't want to die either. So let's just concentrate on the

get a hold of Moogie? <br>
QUARK: They captured the transport ship she was on. <br>
ROM: But she's a female. They're forbidden to travel off of Ferenginar.
<br>
QUARK: Moogie's an exception. The Nagus gave her special dispensation
to travel to Vulcan for her operation. <br>
ROM: What operation? <br>
QUARK: She wanted to have her ears raised. <br>
ROM: I had no idea. <br>
QUARK: That she was so vain? <br>
ROM: That the Nagus could be so generous. <br>
QUARK: He certainly is. <br>
ROM: But why is he being so good to Moogie? <br>
QUARK: Brother, there's something I need to tell you <br>
ROM: You mean that ten bars of latinum is an overly generous finder's
fee? I already know that. <br>
QUARK: It's about the Nagus and Moogie. <br>
ROM: What about them? <br>
QUARK: They're lovers. <br>
ROM: No. <br>
QUARK: It's been going on for over a year. <br>

QUARK: She's his secret financial advisor. She helps him run the entire
Ferengi Alliance. <br>

a Dominion internment centre. Not alone, anyway. <br>
QUARK: You're right. We're going to need help. <br>
ROM: We could put together a commando team. Gather the toughest
mercenaries we can find. Nausicaans, Breen, Klingons. <br>
QUARK: Shh. We don't need Nausicaans, Breen or Klingon. <br>
ROM: Humans? <br>
QUARK: We'll just use Ferengi. <br>
ROM: Then we'll all die. <br>
QUARK: No, we won't. Ferengi can be just as tough as Klingons. <br>

QUARK: Of course they can. They just need the opportunity, the
training, and a couple of bars of latinum as incentive. <br>

QUARK: No, we'll split the reward with whoever joins us. All twenty

QUARK: That's because I had Rom disengage the induction matrix. <br>
KEEVAN: Then why did you bother chasing me? <br>
QUARK: Because sometimes my brother gets things wrong.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Just as Nog and the others finally arrive.) <br>
QUARK: All right, everyone relax. No harm done. We still have our
prisoner. <br>
(An alarm goes off.) <br>
GAILA: What's that? <br>
NOG: It's the alarm I set up. It means a Dominion ship is approaching. <br>
QUARK: To the Infirmary! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They run into the Infirmary, Nog shuts the doors
and they go into a rear surgical unit.) <br>
NOG: Now what? <br>
BRUNT: Someone turned the alarm off. <br>
GAILA: Maybe it went off by itself. <br>
ROM: Do you hear something? <br>
GAILA: Someone's out there. <br>
BRUNT: One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. <br>
QUARK: Me? <br>

JEM'HADAR: Firing line, take aim. <br>
QUARK: Anybody there? <br>
NOG: You could say that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Empok Nor surgery]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROM: I wonder what they're doing out there. <br>
QUARK: Shh. <br>
GAILA: I don't hear anything. <br>
QUARK: Quiet. <br>
NOG: Why are we hiding? <br>
GAILA: There are Jem'Hadar out there. <br>
NOG: Of course they're out there. We asked them to come. <br>
BRUNT: He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you
have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be
firm, strong. <br>
GAILA: But don't get them angry. <br>
ROM: Good luck, brother. Say, hi to Moogie for me. <br>
QUARK: What if it's a trap? <br>
KEEVAN: Of course it's a trap. They're not here to negotiate. They're
here to kill us all. <br>
QUARK: You think? <br>
BRUNT: Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. <br>
KEEVAN: I'm trying to save all our necks. <br>
YELGRUN [OC]: (the Vorta) Ferengi. Show yourself. We're here to trade. <br>
KEEVAN: Don't go out there. We must get back to the ship. Our only hope
is to escape. <br>
NOG: We're not going anywhere, not without Moogie. Right, uncle? <br>
QUARK: Right. <br>
YELGRUN [OC]: Ferengi, I don't like to be kept waiting. <br>
QUARK: I'm coming. I'm coming! And you two are coming with me. <br>
ROM: I was afraid he was going to say that. <br>
QUARK: Rom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Quark, Rom and Nog step out. Yelgrun - <a href="http://www.iggypop.com/main.html" target="_blank">
Iggy Pop</a> - is standing with Ishka and two Jem'Hadar, while
the rest of the
battalion are on the upper level keeping them covered.) <br>
ROM: Moogie! <br>
ISHKA: My boys. I knew you'd come. <br>
ROM: You look beautiful. <br>
ISHKA: My lobes haven't been this firm in over a century. <br>
QUARK: I guess that makes this all worthwhile. <br>
ISHKA: Don't you start with me, Quark. <br>
YELGRUN: What a touching and heartfelt reunion. I'm glad I was here to
witness it. Now, where's Keevan? I wish to conclude this transaction. <br>
QUARK: All in good time. But first, I need some assurances. <br>
YELGRUN: What kind of assurances? <br>
QUARK: Well, for one thing, I don't want any Jem'Hadar soldiers on this
station. <br>
YELGRUN: That would leave me in a very vulnerable position. One Vorta
against six Ferengi. <br>
QUARK: If it makes you feel better, these two can stay. <br>
YELGRUN: I feel safer already. Now where's Keevan? <br>
QUARK: Hold on, I'm not done yet. Then you're going to tell your
helmsman to head back to Dominion territory, warp nine. <br>
YELGRUN: That would leave me stranded here. <br>
QUARK: For a few days. <br>
YELGRUN: I see. And by the time they return, you'll be long gone. <br>
QUARK: That's the idea. <br>
YELGRUN: On the other hand, I could have my Jem'Hadar storm the
Infirmary and kill you all. <br>
ROM: I like our plan better. <br>
QUARK: You attack the Infirmary and Keevan will be the first to die. <br>
YELGRUN: Keevan's fate has already been sealed. <br>
QUARK: Maybe. But before he dies, I'll bet you'll want to know what
Dominion secrets he's revealed to the Federation. <br>
ISHKA: He's got you there, Yelgrun. <br>
YELGRUN: Your people have a reputation for cunning. I see that it's
well earned. Perhaps one day the Ferengi will take their place as
valued members of the Dominion. <br>
QUARK: Anything's possible. <br>
YELGRUN: I will begin to evacuate the Jem'Hadar at once. <br>
QUARK: We can exchange the prisoners in let's say, half an hour? <br>
YELGRUN: We'll be waiting. <br>
NOG: One more thing. How do we know that's really Moogie and not a
changeling? <br>
ISHKA: I think that uniform is too tight on you, Nog. It's cutting off
circulation to your brain. <br>
ROM: Sounds like Moogie. <br>
NOG: Only one way to find out. <br>
(The Jem'Hadar make to shoot Nog.) <br>
YELGRUN: Wait. This should be interesting. <br>
(Nog quickly produces a big knife and cuts Ishka's hand.) <br>
ISHKA: Oww! <br>
QUARK: Yeah, that's blood all right. <br>
ROM: I knew it was Moogie. <br>
ISHKA: Now let's see if you're a changeling. <br>
(Ishka pulls his lobes and hits him over the head.) <br>
NOG: Oww! <br>
ROM: That's no way to tell if he's a changeling. <br>
ISHKA: You're right. Give me that knife. <br>
QUARK: I don't think so. Family. You understand. <br>
YELGRUN: Not really. I was cloned. <br>
ROM: No parents? That explains a lot. <br>
ISHKA: No parents, no sweetheart, no investment portfolio. <br>
YELGRUN: And no patience. We'll meet back here in one half hour. Don't
be late. <br>
ISHKA: You heard him, Quark. Rom, I'm counting on you. Remember, Moogie
loves you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROM: You should've seen my brother. He was
brilliant! <br>
NOG: In a half hour we'll have Moogie back and we can all go home. <br>
GAILA: Home to the torrential rains of Ferenginar. <br>
BRUNT: You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. <br>
QUARK: Yep. <br>
ROM: And the dampness. <br>
LECK: Oh, to stand once more in those rivers of muck. <br>
KEEVAN: I only wish I could be there with you. <br>
ROM: I can't believe it. We're actually going to get the reward money.
Fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. <br>
BRUNT: Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. <br>
QUARK: That's what Rom said, twenty. <br>
LECK: He said fifty. <br>
ROM: I thought you said you didn't care about latinum? <br>
LECK: I don't. I just don't to be cheated. <br>
NOG: Everyone calm down. <br>
GAILA: Calm down? When my dear cousin is trying to cheat me? <br>
QUARK: I'm not trying to cheat anyone. <br>
BRUNT: Then what about the other thirty bars? <br>
NOG: There are no other thirty bars. Are there? <br>
ROM: I, I, no, not really. <br>
LECK: He's lying. They're in it together. <br>
BRUNT: You're not going to get away with this, Quark. <br>
GAILA: I come here, risk my life and for what? You've had this coming
for a long time, cousin. <br>
NOG: No! <br>
ROM: Look out! <br>
(Everyone dives to the side as Gaila shoots and Keevan gets a hole in
his chest.) <br>
KEEVAN: I hate Ferengi. <br>
LECK: You idiot. <br>
(Later, the corpse is on a bed with those forehead things blinking) <br>
ROM: What are we going to do? We can't have a prisoner exchange without
a prisoner. <br>
BRUNT: If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. <br>
QUARK: Will you stop saying that. <br>
GAILA: Maybe if we surrender, they won't hurt us. <br>
BRUNT: I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to
escape. <br>
ROM: It's a big station, easy to get lost in. If we hide, maybe they
won't find us. <br>
QUARK: No one's hiding and no one's escaping, and no one's
surrendering. What's wrong with you people? Have you forgotten the
Battle of Prexnak? <br>
ROM: Who could forget the most important battle in Ferengi history? <br>
QUARK: Ten Ferengi stood alone against two hundred and seventy three
Lytasians. <br>
GAILA: As I recall, all ten Ferengi were slaughtered. <br>
QUARK: The point is, we Ferengi are just as tough as anybody in the
galaxy. And this is our chance to prove it once and for all. <br>
LECK: Quark's right. Let's do it for Ishka. Let's do it for the Grand
Nagus. Let's do it for Ferengis everywhere. <br>
BRUNT: Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed
latinum. <br>
QUARK: It always comes down to profit with you people, doesn't it. <br>
GAILA: We're Ferengi. <br>
QUARK: And that's why I love you. Fifty bars it is, minus my usual
finder's fee. <br>
NOG: Well, there's no doubt about it. According to these readings, this
man is dead. <br>
QUARK: Thank you, Doctor Nog. <br>
NOG: I just wanted to be sure. I thought maybe we could revive him but
I guess not. <br>
(Nog puts another blinkie on Keevan's head and the left arm jerks up
and hits him.) <br>
GAILA: He's alive! <br>
NOG: No, he isn't. It's just the neural stimulator. It caused a
reflexive impulse in his cerebellum. <br>
ROM: I never knew you studied medicine at the Academy. <br>
NOG: I didn't, but if you think about it, medicine isn't that different
from engineering. It's all about keeping things running, fixing broken
parts. <br>
QUARK: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? <br>
NOG: Find me more neural stimulators. <br>
YELGRUN [OC]: It's time, Ferengi. Bring out your prisoner. <br>
NOG: Stall them, Uncle. <br>
QUARK: I'll try.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">YELGRUN: I've done as you asked. The Jem'Hadar are
on their way back to Dominion territory. We are alone on the station. <br>
QUARK: Wonderful. <br>
YELGRUN: Now bring out Keevan and we can conclude our business. <br>
QUARK: Keevan. Right. Absolutely. <br>
YELGRUN: I'm waiting. <br>
QUARK: He'll be right out. But first my brother has to run some sensor
scans to make sure the Jem'Hadar have really left. <br>
YELGRUN: That is unnecessary. The Jem'Hadar are gone. Now bring me
Keevan. <br>
QUARK: I will, in a few minutes. <br>
YELGRUN: No, not in a few minutes, now! Or maybe you've changed your
mind and you don't want your mother back. Kill her. <br>
QUARK: No! <br>
ISHKA: Give them what they want, Quark. <br>
QUARK: I intend to. <br>
YELGRUN: Excellent. <br>
QUARK: As soon as my brother completes his sensor scans. <br>
YELGRUN: And I thought the Breen were annoying. Very well, five
minutes. But I will not tolerate any more delays. <br>
ISHKA: Neither will I. <br>
QUARK: That goes for me, too. You see, we're all in agreement. One more
thing. <br>
YELGRUN: Why am I not surprised? <br>
QUARK: The prisoner exchange. I'd like for it to take place outside
airlock three. <br>
YELGRUN: What's wrong with the Promenade? <br>
QUARK: Nothing, except my ship is docked at airlock three. You
understand. <br>
YELGRUN: Only too well. But I must say your lack of trust saddens me. <br>

futures? <br>
ISHKA: The hipicate root is very versatile. It's used in certain
medicines, defractive optics, and even some beauty supplies. Here, feel
how smooth my head is. Cream of hipicate. I apply it twice a day. You
see, a diversified financial portfolio can mean greater profits and
healthier looking skin. <br>
YELGRUN: Fascinating. I'd love to hear more, but if your son doesn't
show up soon I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you. <br>
QUARK: Yelgrun, you ready? <br>
(Quark and Keevan stand at the end of the corridor. Keevan's head is
tilted to the right.) <br>
YELGRUN: I've been ready for hours. <br>
QUARK: On a count of three, we release our prisoners. Agreed? <br>
YELGRUN: Agreed. <br>
QUARK: One, two three. <br>
(Ishka gets the nod and starts walking. Keevan needs a little shove to
stagger forward, stiff-legged, under Nog's remote control.) <br>
YELGRUN: What have they done to him? <br>
(Keevan starts veering right.) <br>
QUARK: Straighten him out, straighten him out. <br>
NOG: I'm trying. <br>
(Ishka dodges Keevan and gets to Quark for a hug. Keevan bumps into the
bulkhead, repeatedly, like a tin soldier. Quark and Ishka run into the
airlock.) <br>
YELGRUN: Stop them! <br>
A bulkhead opens and Leck downs a Jem'Hadar with a thrown knife.
Yelgrun drops to his knees, Rom shoots the other Jem'Hadar and Keevan
keeps bumping.) <br>
QUARK: Would you please turn him off? <br>
NOG: I can't. The transceiver is jammed. <br>
ISHKA: Oh Quark, the Grand Nagus is going to be so proud of you. I know
I am. <br>
ROM: Moogie. <br>
BRUNT: What do we do with this one? <br>
QUARK: We'll take him with us. He'll be our gift to Starfleet. They
gave us a Vorta, we'll give them one. <br>
YELGRUN: Ferengi. <br>
QUARK: I know, I know. You hate us. <br>
GAILA: All right you, get moving. <br>
LECK: This is the sloppiest, most amateurish operation I've ever seen.
If you ever do something like this again, count me in. <br>
QUARK: You'll be the first one I call. (to Nog) If I even think about
doing something like this again, shoot me. <br>
ROM: So, Brother, how does it feel to be a hero? <br>
QUARK: You tell me. <br>
ROM: It feels good? <br>
QUARK: You bet it does. <br>
(Quark and Rom follow the others into the airlock, leaving the dead
Jem'Hadar and Keevan behind, still bumping into the bulkhead.) <br></font> </p>
