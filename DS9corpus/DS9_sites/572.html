explodes, then the image reverses to the point of detonation.) <br>
KIRA: There. Right there. The explosion began at the intercooler
matrix, and your men were supposed to plant the bomb here, at the
secondary plasma relay. <br>
RUSOT: What difference does that make? The ship was destroyed. <br>
GARAK: The intercooler was the obvious choice for sabotage. Their
security checks could have found the bomb and disarmed it before the
ship left orbit. <br>
RUSOT: But they didn't find it. <br>
KIRA: That isn't the point. Your men ignored their instructions and
their training. <br>
DAMAR: Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a
success. <br>
KIRA: It was a success because the Jem'Hadar security slipped up and we
got lucky. Don't use those men again for anything other than routine
reconnaissance. <br>
RUSOT: They're five of my best men! Bronok is one of the most
experienced <br>
GARAK: You've been told before. No names. <br>
KIRA: Every cell has to be insulated from the cell above and the cell
below. If I know the names of your men and I am captured <br>
RUSOT: Yes. I've heard the lecture. <br>
KIRA: Well then, you shouldn't have to be reminded. <br>

RUSOT: Good idea. The air in here is getting stale. <br>

GARAK: This does not bode well. <br>

KIRA: Odo. <br>
ODO: The raid on the Tevak shipyard was successful. I penetrated the
Operations Centre, disabled the security protocols. The rest of the
team sabotaged the dilithium storage bunkers. An hour after we left,
the entire facility was vaporised. <br>
KIRA: You should get some rest <br>

O'BRIEN: Oh six thirty. Another all nighter? That's four in a row. You
can't keep this up. <br>

I'm not getting anywhere. My DNA integration theory's a blind alley. <br>
O'BRIEN: So where does that leave you? <br>
BASHIR: Back on square one. Whoever engineered this shape-shifter virus
certainly did a good job of covering their tracks. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, it's time to face facts. You're not going to pull a
rabbit out of your medkit. Even the Founders themselves couldn't find a
cure and they had the resources of the entire Dominion at their
command. Now, I know you don't want to hear this, but the only way
we're going to find a cure is to track down whoever created this thing
in the first place. <br>
BASHIR: Miles <br>
O'BRIEN: We have got to find a way to get inside Section Thirty One. <br>
BASHIR: We've tried that. We've tried and we tried and all we managed
to do was to waste two weeks chasing phantoms from here to Vulcan. You
want to face facts? Face this fact. Section Thirty one have managed to
stay in the shadows for over three hundred years. They're not going to
suddenly come scurrying into the light just because Miles O'Brien and
Julian Bashir are on the case! <br>

and let him contact Starfleet Intelligence. Maybe they can <br>
BASHIR: All that will do is alert Section Thirty One to that fact that
we're onto them. And you know what they'll do? They'll go deeper into
hiding. probably send someone here to destroy whatever headway I've
made. No. No more cloak and dagger games. Science is the answer here.
Every puzzle has a solution, every disease a cure. It's just a matter
of finding it. Now, if you'll kindly get the hell out of here, I have
work to do.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GOWRON: Martok's attack on Avenal Seven was a
disgrace. He had the advantage of surprise. The Dominion wasn't
expecting us to take the offensive so soon after the Breen entered the
war. Avenal should have been an easy victory for him, but instead he's
handed us a shameful defeat. <br>
SISKO: General Martok and I both advised you against attacking a world
so deep inside Dominion territory. He was outnumbered six to one at
Avenal. <br>
GOWRON: Six to one. A good commander finds ways to beat the odds, not
hide behind them. <br>
SISKO: He didn't hide behind anything. He fought harder and longer than
I would have in his place. Have you read Worf's after-action report?
Seven Klingon ships destroyed. Five others severely damaged. General
Martok himself in critical condition in the Rotarran Sickbay. <br>
GOWRON: He's expected to survive. <br>
SISKO: That's not the point! This whole operation was a waste of
resources, men and equipment. The blame lies with the man who ordered
the mission in the first place, not with the man who tried to carry it
out. <br>
GOWRON: That's one of the things I like about you, Captain. Your
loyalty to your friends. <br>
SISKO: This has nothing to do with loyalty. <br>
GOWRON: Of course not. In any case, you needn't worry. Martok's a
popular general with the troops and that counts for something. I won't
relieve him of command. Yet. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEYOUN: As you can see, the Klingon raid on Avenal
was easily broken up. <br>
FOUNDER: I am less concerned about this Klingon attack than I am the
Cardassian rebellion. We cannot fight the combined military forces of
the Federation, the Klingons and the Romulans, and face a full-scale
uprising behind the lines. <br>
WEYOUN: I completely agree. However, the situation is well in hand. We
still have control over the Cardassian military, while Damar has only a
handful of terrorists at his disposal. I can assure you both that this
rebellion poses no threat. <br>
PRAN: (electronic noise) <br>
FOUNDER: You are correct. And you also assured us that Damar would
never turn against the Dominion. <br>
WEYOUN: That was an error, to be sure, but an understandable one. No
one could have foreseen that Damar would become a terrorist. The
concept is antithetical to the very nature of Cardassians. They respect
authority. They value the rule of law and the security of order, which
is exactly what the Dominion offers them. <br>
PRAN: (electronic noise) <br>
FOUNDER: Exactly. If our cloning facilities were operational, I would
eliminate this Weyoun immediately. Damar must pay the price for his
treason. Redouble your efforts to find his wife and children. Then I
want you to begin interrogating Cardassian teachers, scientists, local
officials. The population must understand in no uncertain terms that
dissent will not be tolerated. Then I want you to begin putting
Cardassian civilians in and around Dominion military installations. If
Damar destroys another shipyard, he will have to kill a great many of
his countrymen as well. This will help turn the people against him. <br>
WEYOUN: An excellent plan. <br>
FOUNDER: Your opinion was not solicited. Thot Pran, the sooner we can
regain the offensive on the front lines, the better. The installation
of the Breen weapons aboard Dominion ships must be accelerated. Please
issue the appropriate orders to your engineers. <br>
PRAN: (electronic noise) <br>
(Pran leaves.) <br>
FOUNDER: How long before our cloning facilities are operational again? <br>
WEYOUN: Not for several days, perhaps even weeks. <br>
FOUNDER: Ah. Well, keep me informed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GARAK: And according to our new contact on Kelvas
Five, the Breen will begin to install
their energy dampening weapons aboard Jem'Hadar fighters within a week.
<br>
DAMAR: Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these
weapons? <br>
KIRA: No. They're still having trouble understanding the underlying
technology. <br>
DAMAR: Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen
weapons? <br>
KIRA: We don't know that yet either. But if we could supply the
Federation with one, it would give them a chance to come up with a
countermeasure. <br>
GARAK: I had the same thought. <br>
RUSOT: Our priority should be to free Cardassia from the Dominion, not
do Starfleet's dirty work. <br>
DAMAR: We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping
ourselves. <br>
KIRA: There's a Cardassian repair facility in the Kelvas system, right?
<br>
GARAK: Yes. I take it you have something in mind? <br>
KIRA: It won't be easy, but if we can get onto the bridge. All right.
We'll take a five man team. The four of us, plus Odo. Garak, I'm going
to need everything you have on the Kelvas facility. Is something wrong?
<br>
GARAK: Possibly. May I have a few words with the commander? <br>
(Garak takes Kira to a quieter place.) <br>
KIRA: What's on your mind? <br>
GARAK: It's about taking Odo on this mission. I'm afraid there's no
easy way of putting it. He's been hiding the true extent of his illness
from you for some time now. His condition has severely deteriorated.
And the more he changes form, the worse it gets. <br>
KIRA: I know. <br>
GARAK: You do? <br>
KIRA: I love him, Garak. You think I really wouldn't notice? <br>
GARAK: Why the pretence? <br>
KIRA: Because I also know that he doesn't want me to find out about it.
He wants to put up a brave front and protect me from the truth. Well,
fine. If that's what makes this easier for him, if that gives him one
last shred of dignity to hold onto, then I'll go on ignoring what's
happening to him until the very end. Anything else? <br>
GARAK: No. <br>

WORF: He is a stubborn and arrogant man. <br>
SISKO: That may be true, but I hope he's not a fool. He's risking the
entire defence posture. Why can't he see that? <br>
WORF: I suspect the Chancellor cannot see anything at the moment except
for one man. <br>
SISKO: You mean Martok? <br>
WORF: The Chancellor sees him as a political threat. These attacks
against the Dominion are designed to humiliate the General in the eyes
of the Empire. To force him to endure defeat after defeat. <br>
SISKO: Are you telling me that this is a political vendetta? <br>
WORF: It would not be the first time that a Klingon Chancellor put his
own interests ahead of the greater good. <br>
SISKO: Something has to be done. <br>
WORF: Agreed. And I do have a solution. But it will not be easy. <br>

spilling the blood of a Klingon brother while an enemy stands at our

WORF: He is sacrificing our troops for his own petty reasons. Where is

WORF: Kahless himself was not high-born. <br>
MARTOK: Kahless was divine. <br>
WORF: Your name is revered throughout the Empire. If you seize the
leadership, every warrior from here to Kronos would swear an oath to
you. And with that kind of support, the High Council will have no
choice but to accept you as Chancellor. <br>
MARTOK: You begin to sound like a Romulan. <br>
WORF: You know I am right. <br>

dishonour my uniform by raising a hand to my Chancellor in a time of

DAMAR: They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The
Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill
her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind
of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind
of people give those orders? <br>

Asking Martok to stand against Gowron was a foolish error. <br>

WORF: You are still a member of the House of Martok. <br>
EZRI: This is the first that I've heard of it. <br>

EZRI: Okay. But I'm not sure you're going to like it. <br>
WORF: Tell me. <br>
EZRI: I think that the situation with Gowron is a symptom of a bigger
problem. The Klingon Empire is dying. And I think it deserves to die. <br>
WORF: You are right. I do not like it. <br>
EZRI: Don't get me wrong, I'm very touched that you still consider me
to be a member of the House of Martok, but I tend to look at the Empire
with a little more scepticism than Curzon or Jadzia did. I see a
society that is in deep denial about itself. We're talking about a
warrior culture that prides itself on maintaining centuries old
traditions of honour and integrity, but in reality it's willing to
accept corruption at the highest levels. <br>
WORF: You are overstating your case. <br>
EZRI: Am I? Who was the last leader of the High Council that you
respected? Has there even been one? And how many times have you had to
cover up the crimes of Klingon leaders because you were told it was for
the good of the Empire? I know this sounds harsh, but the truth is, you
have been willing to accept a government that you know is corrupt.
Gowron's just the latest example. Worf, you are the most honourable and
decent man I've ever met, and if you're willing to tolerate men like
Gowron, then what hope is there for the Empire?

LUARAN: As you wish. <br>
FOUNDER: Ah. I see the upgraded plasma rifles have been distributed.
May I inspect it? <br>
(A Jem'Hadar hands his over.) <br>
FOUNDER: A-ha. An excellent weapon. What do you think? <br>
(She gives it to Garak, who shoots the Jem'Hadar and the Vorta.) <br>
KIRA: Secure those hatches. <br>
(The Founder morphs into Odo.) <br>
ODO: It wasn't necessary to kill them all. <br>
GARAK: We can't afford to be burdened by prisoners. <br>
KIRA: We'll argue about this later. Prepare to flood all decks below
the bridge with neurazine gas. Bring the warp drive online. Lay in a
course for the Federation. <br>
GARAK: Commander. They haven't finished installing the Breen weapon. We
can't leave. <br>
ODO: How long until they finish installing the weapon? <br>
RUSOT: We can't wait! <br>
KIRA: We're not leaving without that weapon. <br>
GARAK: There are three, no, four Breen working in the engine room.
Judging from the diagnostics, I'd say it'll take them thirty to forty
five minutes to complete their work. <br>
RUSOT: We don't have that much time. <br>
KIRA: Yes, we do. No one even knows we're on the bridge. All we have to
do is sit tight, give the standard replies to any inquiries and wait
for the Breen to do their work. <br>
RUSOT: Damar, this is insane. She'll get us all killed. <br>
GARAK: There's an incoming message. They want to speak to the Vorta. <br>
(Kira takes Luaran's headset.) <br>
KIRA: Disable the visual feed. What was her name? Come on! <br>
GARAK: I'm looking. Ah. Her name was Luaran. <br>
KIRA: This is Luaran. No, I can't see you either. We're experiencing
difficulties with our comm. system. What do you want? Just a moment.
They want the status report on our navigational array. <br>
ODO: I've got it. <br>
KIRA: That data is coming to you. Excellent. We'll be repairing our
comm. system for at least the next hour. I'll contact you when we're
finished. Luaran out. <br>
RUSOT: What if they didn't believe you? <br>
KIRA: Then we're dead.

O'BRIEN: Hey. <br>
BASHIR: Hey. <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko whipped you up some crab rolls. She, we thought you
might be hungry. <br>
BASHIR: Thanks. To both of you. Er, about the other day. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, forget it. How's the work going? <br>
BASHIR: I'm still firmly entrenched in square one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Mind if I ask you a question about Thirty One? <br>
BASHIR: Go ahead. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, if you were to find the cure and they got to know about
it, what do you think they'd do? <br>
BASHIR: Well, I imagine they'd be very concerned. The very existence of
a cure would jeopardise their plan to eradicate the Founders. It
wouldn't surprised me if Sloan or another operative turned up here on
the station to destroy my work. What are you getting at? <br>
O'BRIEN: I think you should send a message to Starfleet Medical saying
that you have found the cure. <br>
BASHIR: You're trying to lure someone from Section Thirty One? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah. That's right. <br>
BASHIR: What happens when this operative gets here? <br>
O'BRIEN: We capture him. Then we figure out a way to get some
information out of him. <br>
BASHIR: He may not know anything about the disease. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe not, but I bet he knows who does. What do you think? <br>
BASHIR: I think it's a plan. A very good plan. When did you get so
devious? <br>
O'BRIEN: I've been hanging around you too long. Let's just hope this
works and we can cure Odo. That's all I care about. <br>
BASHIR: Me too, Miles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GOWRON: Our next target, Sarpedion Five. <br>
MARTOK: Sarpedion is the headquarters of the entire Twelfth Order. <br>
GOWRON: Yes. You'll take fifteen Vorcha class battle cruisers in first
to soften their defences. Then General Chu'vok <br>
MARTOK: Chancellor, that world is one of the most heavily fortified
positions in the entire Cardassian Empire. Fifteen battle cruisers will
barely scratch their defences. <br>
GOWRON: If you lack the courage to fight an uphill battle, then perhaps
you should retire to your bed. <br>
(Martok stands.) <br>
MARTOK: I will fight any battle, anywhere, for the Empire. <br>
GOWRON: Spoken like a true warrior. After Martok has softened their
defences. <br>
(Worf stands.) <br>
WORF: No. We cannot attack Sarpedion. <br>
GOWRON: I decide what can and cannot be done. <br>
WORF: You rule without wisdom and without honour. The warriors that are
gathered here will not say this to you, but I will. You are squandering
our ships and our lives on a petty act of vengeance. <br>
GOWRON: I should have known better than to trust you again. If you were
a true Klingon, I would kill you where you stand. Fortunately for you,
that child's uniform shields you from your rightful fate. <br>
(Worf takes off his comm. badge.) <br>
WORF: What I say now, I say as a member of the House of Martok, not a
Starfleet officer. You have dishonoured yourself and the Empire and you
are not worthy to lead the Council. <br>
GOWRON: There can be only one answer to that. <br>
(Gowron throws his cloak on the table, and the pair take bat'leths from
the wall displays.) <br>
MARTOK: Worf, this is madness. <br>
(Worf knocks Gowron down first but he manages to retaliate. Worf's
blade jabs into a console and Gowron breaks it in two, so Worf knocks
Gowron down and uses the two pieces as daggers. Gowron sends Worf
flying through a glass screen then comes over for the kill, but as he
raises the bat'leth over his head, Worf stabs him in the stomach.) <br>
GOWRON: You will not have this day. <br>
(Gowron falls back. Worf gets up, holds Gowron's eyelids open and does
the death roar. Martok puts the Chancellor's cloak on Worf's
shoulders.) <br>
MARTOK: Hail Worf. Leader of the Empire! Worf! Worf! Worf! <br>
ALL: Worf! Worf! Worf! Worf! <br>
WORF: Wait. Hear me. Hear me! What I have done was for the Empire. A
new day must dawn for our people. I am not the man to usher in that
day. But there is a man here who can. <br>
(Worf takes off the cloak.) <br>
MARTOK: Worf, I do not seek the leadership. <br>
WORF: Kahless said, 'Great men do not seek power, they have power
thrust upon them'. <br>
(Worf puts the cloak on Martok.) <br>
WORF: Hail, Martok! Leader of the Empire! Leader of destiny.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: How much longer? <br>
GARAK: I'm not certain. It appears they're having problems connecting
the secondary relays. <br>
KIRA: Odo, are you all right? <br>
ODO: Yes. Don't worry, I'm <br>
(He collapses and becomes very dry.) <br>
ODO: I'm sorry. <br>
KIRA: There's nothing to be sorry about. Just stay with me, Odo, stay
with me. We're going to get out of here, all right? Just hang on a
little while longer. <br>
RUSOT: It's over. <br>
KIRA: Shut up, Rusot. <br>
RUSOT: The shape shifter is useless. The whole plan is coming apart. We
have to get out of here now! <br>
KIRA: Go back to your post. <br>
RUSOT: No. No more. We're leaving now! <br>
(Rusot points his phaser rifle at Kira.) <br>
GARAK: That would be unwise. <br>
(Garak has his phaser at Rusot's head.) <br>
RUSOT: You're still a Cardassian, Garak. You're not going to kill one
of your own people for a Bajoran woman. <br>
GARAK: How little you understand me. <br>
DAMAR: Put your weapons down, both of you! <br>
RUSOT: You want her dead too, Damar. I know you do. But you're the
leader of the rebellion and don't want to kill someone wearing a
Starfleet uniform. Let me do it for you. <br>
(Beep.) <br>
DAMAR: They've finished installing the dampening weapon. <br>
KIRA: Then let's all get the hell out of here. <br>
RUSOT: Not you. <br>
GARAK: I'm still here, Rusot. <br>
RUSOT: Damar, shoot him. We can kill them both and keep the Breen
weapon for ourselves. I believe in you, Damar. I know you're the right
man to restore the Empire we loyally served. The Empire we loved.
Together we can lead our people to greatness again. Just aim and fire. <br>
(We see Damar fire. We hear a body hit the ground. Obviously it's not
going to be Kira.) <br>
DAMAR: He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be
coming back. <br>
KIRA: Flood all compartments with the gas. Clear all moorings. Bow
thrusters ahead full. <br>
(The Jem'Hadar ship undocks and goes to warp.) <br>
GARAK: We've cleared their defence perimeter. <br>
KIRA: (to Damar) Take the helm. <br>
(Kira goes and sits next to the suffering Odo.) <br>
ODO: You're probably angry. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
ODO: I hid my true condition. <br>
KIRA: Odo, I've known all along. But it's not over. Julian's probably
working on a cure right now and <br>
ODO: Nerys. Nerys, don't. Just stay here with me. </font> </p>
