you while you're here <br>
ARJIN: Oh, you've already been helpful. Just hearing about Dax makes me
feel a little less nervous about the whole thing. <br>
BASHIR: Really? There's no reason to be nervous. Jadzia will be a
wonderful host, Well, that is, she is a wonderful host in a Trill

BASHIR: In what fashion? <br>
ARJIN: Let me put it this way. When I was told that Jadzia Dax had been
designated my field docent, I asked for reassignment. <br>
BASHIR: You're joking. Why? <br>
ARJIN: Because Dax is known for breaking initiates. <br>
BASHIR: Breaking them? <br>
ARJIN: I looked up the records. Over the past two hundred years, Dax
has personally eliminated fifty seven host candidates from the

ARJIN: A what? <br>

for a hundred years introduced it to Curzon. Or was it Lela? Well, it
was ages ago. Try one. You might like it. <br>
ARJIN: Computer, Black Hole. <br>

of the station that they've been hiding in. Now they're spreading out
all over the place. <br>

DAX: A self-exiled Romulan. I collect forgotten composers. Feel like

ARJIN: I've never flown a Federation runabout before. <br>
DAX: These things practically fly themselves. You have third level
flight experience, don't you? <br>
ARJIN: Actually, I just finished fifth level last month. <br>
DAX: Fifth! I didn't finish third level until <br>
ARJIN: Your last year of training. <br>
DAX: You've been studying up on me, Arjin. I can't say that I blame
you. I did the same thing when I found who my field docent was going to
be. <br>
ARJIN: And how did you feel when you found out it was going to be
Curzon Dax? <br>
DAX: Nauseous might be the best description. <br>
ARJIN: I suppose it wouldn't be fair for you to give me a few tips. <br>
DAX: Tips? <br>
ARJIN: On how you managed to impress him. <br>
DAX: Look, let's get one thing straight. I'm not Curzon or Lela or any
of the others. I'm Jadzia Dax, and Jadzia's only a few years older than
you are. You're her first initiate. To be honest, in a lot of ways, I
still feel like an initiate myself. I still can remember the pressure
of the competition when Jadzia was going through it and I'm not going
to make this difficult for you. You don't have to impress me, okay? <br>
ARJIN: Okay. <br>
DAX: Okay. <br>
ARJIN: So how did you? Impress him. <br>
DAX: I didn't. Curzon recommended that my initiate period be
terminated. <br>

DAX: I got it! Engaging manual stabilisers. Shutting down all engines.
Computer, analyse stability loss. <br>
COMPUTER: Stability loss was due to an impact by a subspace interphase
pocket. <br>
DAX: Nature of interphase pocket. <br>
COMPUTER: Unknown. <br>
DAX: Damage report. <br>
COMPUTER: Starboard nacelle nonfunctional. Maximum available power
fifty percent. <br>
ARJIN: Jadzia, you'd better take a look at this. <br>

pathway along the inner hull and try to lure them into a trap. <br>
KIRA: But how can you do that without shutting down all the other power
systems? <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't, and it would take days to round them all up. We'd
have to evacuate the station. The only other thing I can come up with
is a directional sonic generator. Now I can adjust it to a frequency
that'll be uncomfortable to their ears, drive them out of hiding one at
a time. But at that rate, I'll be doing this for the rest of my tour of
duty. <br>

are you going to do about these pests, O'Brien? <br>

KIRA: Chief, the Mekong just came back through the wormhole. They're
showing damage. <br>

Dax? <br>
DAX [on viewscreen]: Our power reserves are gone we could use a tow. <br>
SISKO: What happened? <br>
DAX [on viewscreen]: Not exactly sure. We picked up some kind of
subspace seaweed on our starboard nacelle. We couldn't get rid of it
without causing further damage. <br>

to pad D. <br>
DAX [on viewscreen]: Set up a containment chamber in the science lab
for me, would you, Chief? When we get this thing untangled, I'd like to
study it under controlled conditions. <br>

DAX: So, who sponsored you for the programme? <br>
ARJIN: My father. <br>
DAX: Was he Joined? <br>
ARJIN: No, but he had great ambitions for his children. He was a pilot
instructor at the Gedana post for forty years. He died last year. <br>
DAX: I see where you got your flight skills. <br>
ARJIN: My sister was always his choice for Joining but after she got
accepted to the programme, she ran off and got married. My father never
spoke to her again. On the day that he died, he turned to me and he
said, 'I'm counting on you.' His last words to me. <br>
DAX: Did he want you to enter Starfleet after Joining? To put your
flight training to good use? <br>
ARJIN: Honestly, he couldn't care less what I did afterwards, as long
as I became Joined. That was his only goal. <br>
DAX: And what about your goals? <br>
ARJIN: There are so many possibilities when you're Joined. I'm not sure
what I'd do yet. I figure I'd get a lot of guidance from the symbiont,
wouldn't you say? <br>
DAX: The symbiont's influence is very strong, Arjin, but you're the
host. You've got to be strong enough to balance that influence with
your own instincts. If you can't, the symbiont will overwhelm your
personality.

You're Dax. Standards for Trill hosts? That is really incredible coming

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: I was finally able to read the EM flux. There
are high plasma concentrations and a rapidly expanding mass. <br>
SISKO: How rapidly? <br>
DAX: The energy buildup is already straining the containment chamber.
On top of that, the mass periodically undergoes phased expansions, and
grows in spurts. It's a very specific growth pattern that the computer
recognised. <br>
KIRA: Recognised as what? <br>
DAX: The expansion patterns of a universe. <br>
KIRA: What? <br>
O'BRIEN: A universe? <br>
DAX: What we have here, Benjamin, is a proto-universe in its earliest
stages of formation. Unfortunately, as it grows, it's displacing our
own universe. <br>
SISKO: Can we get it back where it came from? <br>
DAX: This has turned into an energy mass with properties that don't
conform to our own laws of nature. I have no idea what might happen if
we tried to move it, let alone take it back into the wormhole. Even if
we get there, the wormhole's verteron nodes would probably interact
with the energy fluctuations of the proto-universe, causing a
devastating reaction. It could threaten this whole system. <br>
BASHIR: And if we don't do anything, it'll eventually obliterate this
system and beyond. <br>
O'BRIEN: Can't we contain it somehow? <br>
DAX: Not without destroying it. <br>
KIRA: Under these circumstances, that sounds like a pretty good option
to me. <br>
DAX: We can create a forcefield that will contain it. If we can
suppress it long enough, the feedback pressure should create an
implosive wave. It would self-destruct. <br>
SISKO: How long before the next phase of expansion? <br>
DAX: About three hours. The collateral shock waves will probably
destroy the lab. <br>
SISKO: Can we get this containment field ready by then? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: Have Odo evacuate section fourteen. Dismissed.

at all the training profiles, but that doesn't tell you who Jadzia
really was before she was Joined. She was the quietest, shyest, most
withdrawn young woman you've ever known. Brilliant, top grades, and not
a clue to what life was about. She'd never lived outside the programme
and it didn't matter because she was sailing through it, until she met
Curzon Dax. Curzon sized her up in about twenty seconds and made the
next two weeks the most miserable of her life. She cried herself to
sleep every night. She hated him for it. But when the field training
was over and she learned about Curzon's recommendation to terminate her
from the programme, she went back a different woman. She found her
voice and reapplied. She tore through the programme with a passion, a
vengeance. And in the end the administrators chose her for Joining. <br>
ARJIN: How did you wind up with the Dax symbiont? <br>
DAX: When I found out Curzon was dying, I requested the Dax symbiont. <br>
ARJIN: And Curzon didn't object? <br>
DAX: No. And I've never been sure quite why, except as I've come to
know Curzon's dark sense of humour, I have a feeling the irony might
have appealed to him. Jadzia Dax is not Curzon Dax, but I am Dax and
I'm slowly coming to terms with what that means to me. Sometimes it
means gambling or wrestling. Sometimes it means waking up an initiate
before he slides into the middle of the pack and gets overlooked. <br>
