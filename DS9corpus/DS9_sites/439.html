awkward customer.) <br>
QUARK: He only paid for one hour. He's been in there for three,
fighting the Battle of Klachdachbrach or some such thing over and over.
<br>
ODO: The Battle of Klach D'kel Brakt was a legendary Klingon victory
over the Romulans almost a century ago. <br>
QUARK: Well, he's been losing it all afternoon and he says he's not
coming out until he wins. I banged on the door, he sealed himself in. I
threatened to shut off the power, he threatened to kill me.

ODO: Since when did you add ancient Klingon battles to your holosuite
programs? <br>
QUARK: The Captain of the last Klingon ship that went through the
wormhole sold some to me. I know, I know. It's brutal, it's violent,
it's bloody, but to the Klingons, it's entertainment. <br>
ODO: Shut off the power. <br>
QUARK: He'll kill you. <br>
ODO: No, he said he'll kill you. Shut it off. <br>

ODO: That doesn't answer my question. <br>
KOLOTH: Yes. It does. What are the charges against him? <br>
ODO: Charges? No charges. He's today's guest of honour. <br>
KOLOTH: You must be a very brave man to attempt humour at the expense

so long. It's been a Klingon afternoon. <br>
KIRA: A Klingon afternoon? <br>
ODO: Every time Klingons come to the station, I wind up with a Klingon
afternoon. But this was definitely one I'll cherish forever. There's a
drunk Klingon in my holding cell, must be a hundred years old, singing
battle songs. Even his best friend who's probably a hundred and fifty
years old won't have anything to do with him, so I get the pleasure of
listening to his repertoire. Kor, Dahar Master of the Klingons. <br>
DAX: Did you say Kor? <br>
ODO: That's what he announced right after winning the Battle of Klach
D'kel Brakt at Quark's. <br>
DAX: What is he doing here? Did you get his friend's name? Was it Kang?
<br>
ODO: No, it was <br>

ODO: Lieutenant. <br>
DAX: I'll take responsibility. <br>
KOR: I am very thirsty. <br>
DAX: Kor, do you remember Curzon Dax? <br>
KOR: Curzon? My dear friend Curzon? I lift my ghoptu to Curzon Dax! <br>
DAX: And I, who was Curzon Dax lift my ghoptu to you. Scorcher burn on
your fourteenth rib, and your left QiVon aches every time your ship
hits warp eight. <br>

DAX: I'm Jadzia now. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KOR: Look at him. He practices cuts and thrusts
even with his food. Little children do that. <br>
KOLOTH: A sharp knife is nothing without a sharp eye. <br>
KOR: It's been forty years since even his good eye was sharp. It is
luck when you hit the plate. <br>
KOLOTH: I see the Federation insults us by sending a Lieutenant to
greet us. <br>
DAX: You never had much use for the Federation, did you, Koloth. I used
to call you D'akturak, Ice man, because no proposal, no matter how
reasonable, no matter how much it favoured the Klingon Empire would
satisfy you. You were the toughest man I ever faced across the
negotiations table. <br>
KOR: Do you not recognise our old friend Dax? <br>
KOLOTH: Dax? <br>
DAX: Curzon's dead, but Dax is alive as part of me. <br>
KOLOTH: This is a mistake. Kang must not have known. <br>
KOR: Ah, but what a beautiful mistake. <br>
DAX: Is Kang coming? <br>
KOR: Of course he's coming. He's brought the four of us back together
after eighty one years. <br>
DAX: Could it possibly mean that he's <br>
KANG: Yes. That is exactly what it means. I have found the Albino. <br>
(And Michael Ansara. We have the original three all in one place.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Four drinks are replicated, but only Kor takes a
glass.) <br>
DAX: Kang, do you remember the first time we sat together over bahgol?
It was the Korvat colony. The Federation and the Klingon Empire were
still enemies. <br>
KANG: I have never sat with you before today. <br>
DAX: I am Dax, godfather of your son. <br>
KOLOTH: You are no one's godfather. <br>
DAX: I am Dax, godfather of your son <br>
.
KANG: So, you are the same Dax who took a blood oath with us to seek
vengeance? <br>
DAX: Don't mistake a new face for a new soul, Kang. I still feel at one
with your family just as I did eight decades ago. I hope one day you
will embrace me as a brother again. <br>
KOLOTH: Brother! Ha! <br>
KOR: Brother, sister, what's the difference. We're here now. Speak to
us, Kang. Where is he? Where did you find the Albino? <br>
KANG: Seven years ago, on Dayos Four, I met one of the Albino's
discarded wives. I fed and clothed her. I told her the story of our
sons. She still feared him and told me nothing. Three months ago, she
died. A week afterwards, an amulet she wore around her neck was
delivered to me by messenger. In it was the location of the Albino's
sanctuary. <br>
KOLOTH: Are you certain that he's still there? <br>
KANG: I have confirmed it with traders who supply him. It is on the
fourth planet in the Secarus System. He has been hiding there for
nearly a quarter of a century. <br>
KOR: Hiding from us, no doubt. <br>
KANG: I have been told he only has forty men in his compound. Evidently
he has become very lax in his waning years. <br>
KOR: The fool. <br>
DAX: I wouldn't count on information from traders. The Albino might
have told them what to say if anyone asked questions. <br>
KOLOTH: She's right. The traders may already have warned him that we
are coming. <br>
KANG: They will never warn anyone ever again. This time, we will reach
the Albino. And when we do, I will cut his heart out and eat it while
he watches me with his dying breath.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Promenade - upper level]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KANG: I did not know, of course. <br>
DAX: About Curzon? <br>
KANG: I did not want to risk contacting you by subspace. <br>
DAX: I don't blame you. That's how the Albino learned we were coming to
Galdonterre. <br>
KANG: His ears that reach across the galaxy. I don't know how. Tell me
about my friend Curzon. Did he die an honourable death? <br>
DAX: He died in a hospital room yelling at doctors and friends who were
trying to keep him alive for one more miserable day. <br>
KANG: That's a pity. He was a good man. He deserved to die in battle.
It pains me that I will never see him again in this life. <br>
DAX: Curzon was decorated many times for his diplomatic achievements,
but no honour touched him as deeply as yours. For a Klingon to choose a
Federation official to be the godfather of his son. <br>
KANG: Curzon Dax opened the door to peace. He was the first Federation
diplomat I ever met who truly seemed to understand the Klingon nature. <br>
DAX: Well, there was always a bit of the Klingon nature in Curzon. His
blood oath with you was very important to him. <br>
KANG: Would you eat from the heart of the Albino, Jadzia Dax? I know
about the Trills during my long friendship with Curzon. And I know that
each new host has no obligation to past commitments. <br>
DAX: And I know that a Klingon blood oath can never be broken. <br>
KANG: The old Klingon ways are passing. There was a time, when I was a
young man, the mere mention of the Klingon Empire made worlds tremble.
Now, our warriors are opening restaurants and serving racht to the
grandchildren of men I slaughtered in battle. Things are not what they
used to be, not even a blood oath. <br>
DAX: I know you, Kang. You don't believe that. <br>
KANG: What I believe is no longer relevant. You are released from
Curzon's oath. You owe nothing to any of us.

pylon one? I can't seem to find it now. <br>

KIRA: Uh huh? <br>
DAX: How many people did you kill? <br>
KIRA: What? <br>
DAX: While you were in the underground. <br>
KIRA: Too many. <br>
DAX: Were they all faceless Cardassians or did you know who you were
killing? <br>
KIRA: Why are we talking about this? <br>
DAX: If it bothers you, we can stop. <br>
KIRA: It bothers me. <br>
DAX: I'm sorry. <br>
KIRA: Why, are you thinking about killing somebody? <br>
DAX: Me? <br>
KIRA: Tell me. <br>
DAX: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
KIRA: Tell me. <br>
DAX: Eighty years ago, there was a band of depredators, led by an
Albino, raiding Klingon colonies. Three Klingon warships were sent to
stop him. One of the captains was a close friend of Curzon's. The
mission was successful. Most of them were captured. But the Albino
escaped. In his last message to the Klingons, he promised to take his
revenge on the firstborn of each of the three captains. A few years
later, he kept his word. Somehow, he infected three innocent children
with a genetic virus that killed them. One of them was my godson. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry. But Jadzia, that was Curzon's godson. <br>
DAX: I took a blood oath to revenge his death. <br>
KIRA: Curzon took a blood oath. <br>
DAX: I can still remember the boy's funeral. He was named Dax for me. <br>
KIRA: You've found this Albino? <br>
DAX: We know where he is. The three Klingons came here to tell me. <br>
KIRA: Look, you've said yourself every new life for a Trill has to be a
new life. If not, you'd wind up paying off old debts forever. These
Klingons can't possibly expect you to keep this oath. <br>
DAX: No, they don't. That's just it. They say I have no obligation to
them. But I do. I know it, I feel it. If not to them, I owe it to
Curzon. <br>
KIRA: Jadzia. Your questions about my experience with killing. If
you're wondering what it's like. When you take someone's life, you lose
a part of your own as well. </font></p>

KOR: majQa'! To the rescue. Dax, may I present these two students of
Klingon history. <br>
DAX: Would you excuse us for a minute? <br>
KOR: Only a minute, my students. <br>
(The girls leave them) <br>
KOR: Well, you certainly don't share Curzon's priorities. <br>
DAX: About going after the Albino, I do. Kang and Koloth don't want me
to come with you. <br>
KOR: Kang thinks too much. Koloth doesn't feel enough. <br>
DAX: And where do you stand? <br>
KOR: Of course you should come! The splendour of fighting and killing.
A bloodbath in the cause of vengeance.
Who wouldn't want to come? <br>
DAX: Will you speak to them for me? It means far more to me than I
realised. <br>
KOR: Koloth spends all his time practicing in the holosuite. He listens
to no one. And if Kang's made up his mind, there's nothing I can do. <br>
DAX: And you call yourself a history teacher? What of your own history?
You are Kor, Dahar Master. They cheered you at Klach D'kel Brakt. Your
voice weighed heavily on the course of Klingon events. <br>
KOR: You shame me. <br>
DAX: No, please don't feel that. <br>
KOR: The only weight I carry now, dear comrade, is my own bulbous body.
I was once, if you remember, far less than you see, and far more than I
have become. I'm sorry. <br>

to bond himself to us in a blood oath. <br>
DAX: That's a lie. <br>
KOLOTH: Are you? (pause) I am practicing here. Leave while you can. <br>
DAX: When you agree that I can fulfill my part of the oath. <br>
KOLOTH: You? Your presence will jeopardise the rest of us. Leave me! <br>

sixteen centimetres, weight five point three kilos with an exterior
handgripping diameter of five centimetres. Blades composite baakonite. <br>
KOLOTH: Ah, a warrior's configuration. Now what are you going to do
with it? <br>

now. <br>

DAX: You said that to me before, Kang. Do you remember? <br>
KANG: I do not care to discuss it any further. <br>
DAX: The Korvat colony. First day of negotiations. I walked out on you
right in the middle of that long-winded speech of yours. You should
have seen the look on your face. Nobody ever had the kajunpak't to show
their back to the great Kang before Curzon did. <br>
KANG: I almost killed Curzon that day. <br>
DAX: I knew I had to get you very, very angry or my mission wouldn't
succeed. Getting you angry at me was the only way to begin to create a
bond between us. <br>
KANG: Curzon understood Klingons. <br>
DAX: And he understood what he was doing when he took a Klingon blood
oath. You can't expect me to stay here and not avenge my own godson's
murder. You can't ask me to live with that kind of dishonour. <br>
KANG: I cannot dishonour myself by permitting you to die in Curzon's
place. <br>
DAX: Who's talking about dying? I have no intention of dying. You
dishonour yourself already, Kang, by placing your own honour above
mine. No Klingon warrior would leave a comrade behind while he goes off
to battle. Perhaps you're right. Klingon honour isn't what it used to
be. <br>

would work twice?! <br>

DAX: Don't do it, Benjamin. Don't make me disobey a direct order. <br>
SISKO: I never understood this. I mean, whatever else Curzon was, he
did have a fundamental morality. He wouldn't condone murder any more
than I would, and yet he swore to kill this Albino and now you plan to
go out and kill in his name. What about the laws of the Federation? <br>
DAX: The Klingons have their own set of laws. This is justice to them. <br>
SISKO: And to you? <br>
DAX: I've chosen to respect their codes of honour in this matter, yes. <br>

KANG: That's what I'm told. <br>
KOR: Perhaps he thinks we're already dead and have stopped chasing him.
<br>
DAX: Or perhaps he has made his defences look weak for our benefit. <br>
KOLOTH: She may be right. <br>
DAX: We have to assume the guards patrol the perimeter. At seventy-five
metres apart, they're out of eye contact with each other <br>
KOR: He wouldn't be that stupid. We must expect them to be no farther
than fifty metres apart. <br>
KANG: Fine. It makes no difference. <br>
DAX: Doesn't it? If we assume he has adequate defences, a minimum of
fifty guards, then we should use a N'yengoren strategy. <br>
KANG: No! I will not sneak into his bedroom and murder him like a
kah'plakt. I want him to see us coming. I say we make a direct attack
boldly through the threshold. The guards will be too scattered to
defend against us. We will overwhelm them to glorious victory. <br>

DAX: So, we talk about dying again. <br>
KANG: A Klingon warrior is always prepared to die. <br>
DAX: Yes, but to invite death with a direct assault against a superior
force? Kang, what are you doing? What's really going on here? Loyalty
blinds Kor and Koloth, but not me. This is not a plan for battle, it's
a plan for suicide. If it were someone else, I might think you were
paid to lure us here. <br>
KANG: How could you say that? I took a blood oath with you. <br>
DAX: Is this why you didn't want me to come? Because you knew you were
coming to die? <br>
KANG: When the amulet arrived with the location of the Albino, I went
to the Secarus system to see if it was true. Somehow, the instant I
arrived the Albino knew I was there. He contacted me. He sent an
invitation to one last glorious battle. He said he is tired of this
lifelong pursuit. He swore to send forty of his strongest and most
skilled men against us in honourable combat. And I agreed. <br>
DAX: But why? <br>
KANG: Because this is our last chance. If we cannot reach the Albino,
we can at least die an honourable death trying to reach him. A death a
Klingon Dahar Master deserves. <br>
DAX: You know what, Kang? I think you Klingons embrace death too
easily. You treat death like a lover. I think living is a lot more
attractive. I think an honourable victory is better than an honourable
defeat. <br>
KANG: I know the Albino's defences. There is no chance of victory here.
<br>
DAX: What if they had no phasers? That might make the odds a little
better, don't you think? <br>
KANG: How do you intend to disarm them all? <br>
DAX: When we establish a low orbit, we modulate your disruptor banks to
bombard the compound with tetryon particles. Every directed energy
weapon will be neutralised. <br>
KANG: You're certain such a thing could be done? <br>
DAX: If Curzon were here, you'd be out of luck, but Jadzia Dax is a
science officer. <br>
KANG: We would also be unable to use our disruptors. But who among them
could match our skills with the bat'leth? <br>
DAX: Not many. We're about forty minutes away from the Secarus System.
I think we should cloak and then you and I, old friend, should sharpen
our blades too. <br>
KANG: Perhaps it is a good day to live! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The compound is a castle, with battlements and
revetments. Dax has been using her tricorder.) <br>
DAX: You say they promised you an honourable battle. Hand to hand
combat at the main threshold. <br>
KANG: That's right. <br>
DAX: Take a look at this. This indicates a gravitic mine buried at the
main threshold. <br>
KOLOTH: Yes, and he plans to detonate it the moment we enter the
compound. <br>
KOR: That's what you get for making a deal with the devil, Kang. <br>
DAX: On the other hand, this gives us an advantage we wouldn't
otherwise have. He's expecting us at the front door. <br>
KOR: How do we know that he's even inside? <br>
DAX: Good question. <br>
KOLOTH: Wait here. <br>
KOR: Where are you going? <br>
KOLOTH: I'm going to find out if he's inside. <br>
KOR: How do you intend to do that? <br>
KOLOTH: I'll ask somebody. <br>
(Koloth marches off) <br>
KANG: We would be wise to shut down his sensor array before we attack.
It's controlled from this power station. <br>
KOR: Yes, but a power failure will signal our presence. At the same
time that you shut down the sensors, I'll create a diversion at the
armoury to misdirect their response. <br>
DAX: A good strategy. But whoever creates the diversion will have to
run across this field to escape. With all due respect, none of you are
as quick as you once were. I'll volunteer for that job. <br>
KANG: Agreed. <br>
(Koloth finds a lookout amongst the bushes.) <br>
(Meanwhile, the main party has moved forward.) <br>
KANG: It seems this is best place for entry right here. <br>
KOLOTH: I encountered a helpful lookout. The Albino is inside. <br>
KOR: His overconfidence will be the death of him. <br>
KOLOTH: He's in there now, but the moment we attack, he will move to a
secured command post here. <br>
KANG: It will be midday in one hour. Can you create the diversion in
the armoury by then? <br>
DAX: I think so. <br>
KANG: We will be in position at the powerhouse <br>
KANG: May Kahless guide us on this day of vengeance.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(One guard gets his throat cut. Another gets the
direct approach) <br>
DAX: Excuse me. Could you tell me where the tennis courts are? I seem
to be lost. <br>
(Then he gets knocked out. Shortly afterwards, KaBOOM! gets the
attention of the Albino. Jadzia runs as the guards point their useless
weapons at her.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALBINO: Report. <br>
GUARD: The armoury's been sabotaged. I've diverted the forward patrols
to that area. <br>
ALBINO: Cancel those orders. Move all guards to the inner defence line.
Make sure the power station is secure. <br>
GUARD: Go! <br>
GUARD 2: Yes, sir. <br>
GUARD: None of the phasers are functioning <br>
ALBINO: Not functioning? <br>
GUARD: We're running diagnostics now. <br>
ALBINO: Use long range sensors to check for interference from a cloaked
ship in orbit. In the meantime, have the guards fix kuttars to their
rifles and prepare for hand-to-hand combat. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GUARD: I can't make contact with the power station.
<br>
ALBINO: They must have already broken through the inner defence line.
Move the perimeter guards into the house. <br>
GUARD: Sir, without power, we have no communications. <br>
ALBINO: Then get out there and tell them yourself. I don't want that
Klingon filth to get in this <br>
(Boom! The doors are blown in and the magnificent four are there) <br>
KANG: Look upon your executioners, killer of children. <br>
ALBINO: (using the guard as a shield) Get them! <br>
(The Albino lets his guards to all the fighting and dying. Then Koloth
is wounded) <br>
KOR: Koloth! <br>
(Kor fights through to his friend.) <br>
KOLOTH: I didn't see him coming. <br>
KOR: Even you cannot have eyes in the back of your head, my friend.
Quiet now. Rest. I still have work to do. <br>
(Kang is injured as well, and joins Koloth) <br>
KOLOTH: I will not die before you, you thunderous bulk. <br>
KOR: The story of your courage will never die. I will sing the story.
The children of all Klingons will know of this day. <br>
(Koloth dies) <br>
(Kang deals with the guard that the Albino is cowering behind.) <br>
ALBINO: You'll die far quicker than your son did, Kang. <br>
(Finally the two old enemies go head to head. Dax finishes off the last
guard as Kang breaks his bat'leth against a railing. The Albino stabs
him in the stomach.) <br>
ALBINO: No vengeance today, Kang. <br>
(Dax knocks the weapon out of the Albino's hand) <br>
ALBINO: And who are you, girl? <br>
DAX: You knew me as Curzon Dax. <br>
ALBINO: The Trill. Of course. You're far too young and lovely to sport
such a deadly weapon. All right, then. <br>
(The Albino puts his neck in the curve of the blade) <br>
ALBINO: Use it, if that's what you came to do. Kill me in cold blood.
Run me through the belly and cut out my heart. Isn't that what your
blood oath promised? Or have you lost your appetite, my dear. <br>
(Kang stabs the laughing Albino in the back) <br>
KANG: Thank you for saving the death blow for me. You have honoured me
one last time, godfather to my son. <br>
(Kor staggers amongst the corpses) <br>
KANG: Where is Koloth? <br>
KOR: He is dead. <br>
KANG: I was right, Dax. It is a good day to die. <br>
(And does so.) <br>
DAX: It's never a good day to lose a friend. <br>
