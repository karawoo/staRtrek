WORF: Chief, I'm certain Doctor Bashir and Major Kira are taking good
care of your wife. <br>
DAX: And besides, you know there's no way you could have kept Keiko
from going. She's been talking about the botanical mysteries on Torad
Five for a long time. You're lucky she agreed to limit the trip to
three days. <br>
O'BRIEN: Three days in the Gamma Quadrant. Do you know what she wanted
to do last week? <br>
DAX: What? <br>
O'BRIEN: She wanted to go back to Bajor and rappel down the cliffs of
Undalar to get a fungus sample. Rappel to get fungus! It's as if I have
to remind her that she's pregnant. <br>
DAX: Yeah, I guess the extra weight, the morning sickness, the mood
swings, the medical examinations, they aren't reminders enough. <br>

QUARK: Hey! <br>
CROWD: Dabo! <br>
GIRL: Very good, we have a winner. <br>
QUARK: Rom, my brother! (hugs him) I'm glad to see you. Let me pour you
a snail juice. <br>
ROM: Okay. But only one. My shift starts in thirty three minutes. <br>
QUARK: I'll make it a tall one and it's on the house. We're
celebrating. <br>
ROM: Celebrating? What? <br>
QUARK: My return from two weeks on Ferenginar. Didn't you miss me? <br>
ROM: I suppose. <br>
QUARK: And I missed you. That's two reasons for celebrating. Enjoy. <br>
ROM: Thanks. <br>
QUARK: Just the way you like it? <br>
ROM: Perfect. So, how was your trip? Did you close the vole belly deal?
<br>
QUARK: The what? Oh, yeah. Closed it on the first day. Fifteen percent
profit margin. <br>
ROM: Great. Did you see Moogie? <br>
QUARK: Mother's fine. She sends her love. <br>
ROM: What else did you do? <br>
QUARK: Well, let's see. Closed the deal. Told you that. Did some
shopping. Made a pilgrimage to the Great Marketplace. And, er, oh, yes,
I found out (shouts) I'm dying! <br>
(Stunned silence and open mouths in the bar.) <br>
QUARK: what are you all looking at? Haven't you ever seen a dying man
before? <br>
ROM: You're dying? <br>
QUARK: I got my results from my annual insurance physical. All the
tests came back negative except for one. I have Dorek Syndrome. <br>
ROM: But that's incurable. <br>
QUARK: That's right. Which explains the dying part. <br>
ROM: But Dorek Syndrome? It's so rare. <br>
QUARK: It strikes only one out of every five million Ferengi. I finally
beat the odds. <br>
ROM: How long do you have before? <br>
QUARK: According to Doctor Orpax, six days, maybe seven. <br>
ROM: Is he sure? <br>
QUARK: Oh, of course he's sure. He's one of the most expensive doctors
on Ferenginar. He charges two strips of latinum just to walk into the
waiting room. <br>
ROM: This is terrible! I don't want you to die, brother. Maybe you
should get a second opinion. Have Doctor Bashir examine you when he
gets back from the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
QUARK: Bashir? How good can he be? He doesn't even charge. Besides what
could a human doctor know about Dorek Syndrome? <br>
ROM: You're going to die. <br>
QUARK: I have six days to take care of everything. My will, Moogie's
pension, I have to make funeral arrangements, pay off my debts. <br>
ROM: That's a lot of debts, brother. <br>
QUARK: Yeah, but half are to humans, Bajorans, a couple of Klingons. <br>
ROM: Rule of Acquisition seventeen. A contract is a contract is a
contract. But only between Ferengi. <br>
QUARK: Exactly. But you're right. It's still a lot of debt. <br>
ROM: You can always sell the desiccated remains of your corpse on the
Ferengi Futures Exchange. <br>
QUARK: Who'd want to buy a disk of desiccated Quark? I'm nobody. Just
some bartender with a domineering mother and an idiot brother. <br>
QUARK: I won't get any cheers for that. <br>
ROM: You were the Grand Nagus. <br>
QUARK: For a week. If I'm lucky, I'll be a footnote in some Ferengi
financial almanac. <br>
ROM: You anticipated the change of administrations here on the station.
<br>
QUARK: And as a reward I'm inextricably linked to the Federation. I'm a
joke on Ferenginar. Starfleet's favourite bartender. The Synthehol
King. What a legacy. <br>
ROM: You're not a joke here. You're a respected businessman, a pillar
of the community, a man with many friends. <br>
QUARK: Friends? Community? You sound like some sniveling human. The
only opinions I care about are those of my peers. Ferengi businessmen.
In their eyes, I'm a second-rate, small-time operator. <br>
ROM: Stop it! Stop it, brother! You are somebody. You'll see. You march
right over to that comm. link and offer your vacuum-desiccated remains
for sale on the Futures Exchange. You'll see. Bids'll come flooding in
from all over the Ferengi Alliance. Everyone will want a disk of Quark
on their desk. In fact, there may not be enough of you to meet the
demand. <br>
QUARK: You're a liar. but I love you. <br>
ROM: Just wait. When you see how much your body is worth you're going
to wish you'd died years ago, or something like that. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Kira almost had us clear of the asteroid
field, and then the deflectors became overwhelmed. We were side-swiped
by a rock the size of this room. A fuel pod exploded and Keiko was
thrown against the bulkhead. She had a concussion, broken ribs,
internal haemorrhaging. I managed to stabilise her but the baby's
autonomic functions were failing. I had to find another womb for the
baby, and the only two people available were Major Kira and me. <br>
SISKO: I think you made the right choice, Doctor. <br>
O'BRIEN: But the Major's Bajoran. How can she carry a human child? <br>
BASHIR: I had to stimulate Kira's estrogen and progesterone production,
and administer high doses of tesokine to enable the baby to metabolise
Bajoran nutrients. <br>
SISKO: But the bottom line is it worked, right? <br>
BASHIR: Right. <br>
O'BRIEN: So, when will Keiko will be strong enough to take the baby
back? <br>
BASHIR: Well, Keiko should be up on her feet in a day or two. However,
the baby <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
BASHIR: Major Kira will have to carry the baby to term. You see, Chief,
Bajoran women carry their children for less than five months. Because
they have such a short gestation period, they vascularise very quickly.
Mother and child form a complex interconnecting network of blood
vessels. In order to transfer the baby back to Keiko, I would have to
sever those ties, which would likely cause massive internal haemorrhage
in Kira and a severe respiratory trauma for the baby. <br>
O'BRIEN: So, what you're telling me is that Major Kira's going to have
my baby?

ROM: Did you get lots of bids? <br>
QUARK: I wouldn't say lots. <br>
ROM: How many? <br>
QUARK: Let me count. One. <br>
ROM: Oh? Seventeen bars, three strips and five slips of latinum for the
entire collection. It's a generous opening bid. <br>
QUARK: It's an insultingly low offer. Oh, and it also happens to be
exactly the sum total of your life savings. <br>
ROM: Oh? What a coincidence. <br>
QUARK: Stop it. I don't want your charity. <br>
ROM: It's not charity. I want to have something to remember you by when
you're gone. <br>

coming here, putting a bar on this Cardassian monstrosity of a station.
What was I thinking? <br>
ROM: Brother, come here quick. It's a bid. <br>
QUARK: A bid. <br>
ROM: A huge bid. <br>
QUARK: Five hundred bars of latinum for the entire set. <br>

QUARK: No kidding. <br>
ROM: You think it's Moogie? <br>
QUARK: Nah, she doesn't like me that much. She might buy one disk but
all fifty two? No. Who could it be? Who could afford to spend five
hundred bars of latinum on me? Grand Nagus Zek. <br>
ROM: The Nagus? <br>
QUARK: Of course. It makes perfect sense. He always liked me. <br>
ROM: He used you when it suited his needs. I don't think it's the same
thing. <br>
QUARK: Don't you see? He used me because he liked me. He couldn't admit
that in public, so he made this anonymous bid as a gesture of his
appreciation and gratitude. <br>
ROM: That doesn't sound like the Nagus I know. But it doesn't matter
who made the offer. The important thing is this could stimulate further
bidding. <br>
QUARK: Well, let's not be foolish, Rom. If we wait, the Grand Nagus
might just change his mind. Going once, going twice, sold! <br>

BRUNT: Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. <br>

your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. <br>
QUARK: You're the anonymous buyer? <br>

BRUNT: You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about
it. <br>
QUARK: But then I don't understand. What are you doing here? <br>

discs of
vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make
sure you deliver the merchandise. <br>
QUARK: Maybe I wasn't clear. I'm not dying. <br>
BRUNT: Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I
have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my
favourites? <br>
QUARK: Oh, I see. How foolish of me. I forgot to mention that on top of
your full refund, you'll also be receiving an additional five bars of
latinum for your troubles. Did I say five? I meant ten. You drive a
hard bargain. Twelve. That's my final offer. Look, it's late, you've
come a long way. Why don't we stop this haggling and you just tell me
how much you want. <br>
BRUNT: What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark.
Nothing more, nothing less. <br>
QUARK: But I'm not going to die just yet! What do you expect me to do?
Kill myself? <br>
BRUNT: Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend
strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. <br>
QUARK: You can't be serious? <br>
BRUNT: A contract is a contract <br>
QUARK: Is a contract. I know that! But you don't collect on contracts
under these circumstances. We're not Klingons. We're businessmen. <br>
BRUNT: This is not business, Quark. This is personal. <br>
QUARK: Why? What have I ever done to you? <br>
BRUNT: Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've
ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No.
Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with
your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and
insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what
you've done but for who you are, what you are. <br>
QUARK: A bartender? <br>
BRUNT: A philanthropist. <br>
QUARK: I am not! <br>
BRUNT: You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a
thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food
and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! <br>
QUARK: That's not true. It was just above cost. <br>
BRUNT: Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture.
You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their
uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a
bad name. <br>
QUARK: I can reform. I'll start gouging the customers again. I'll
revoke all my employees' vacation time. <br>
BRUNT: You gave them vacations? <br>
QUARK: I didn't give them anything. They contributed to a central fund
which I manage. <br>
BRUNT: You disgust me. <br>
QUARK: Look, I understand your anger. You're absolutely right about me,
but there must be some accommodation we can make? Something other than
me killing myself. <br>
BRUNT: Of course there is. You can break the contract. <br>
QUARK: Me, break a Ferengi contract? Never. <br>
BRUNT: Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick
to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you
and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the
lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets,
begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business
with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with
your own people. <br>
QUARK: I like Ferengi. I feel comfortable around them. <br>

Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my
job to cut you off.

GARAK: We're running out of options, Quark. You don't want to be
vaporised because you need a body. The disruptor ruined your clothing.
The knife was too savage. The nerve gas smelled bad. Hanging took too
long, and poison. What was wrong with poison? <br>
QUARK: It doesn't work. If I know the food is poisoned, I won't eat it.
Could you get rid of this? The sight of it makes me sick. <br>
GARAK: Computer, remove corpse. For a man who wants to kill himself,
you're strangely determined to live. <br>
QUARK: I am going to die, don't you worry about that. I just want to
find the right way. <br>
GARAK: Right way? <br>
QUARK: I don't want to see it coming, or hear it, or feel it, or smell
it. I just want to go on with my life and then, I'm dead. <br>
GARAK: Ah. You want to be surprised. <br>
QUARK: Exactly. I want to wake up in the Divine Treasury and have no
idea how I got there. <br>
GARAK: I see. Perhaps that can be arranged. <br>
QUARK: Really? <br>
GARAK: You have my word. You'll never know what hit you. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(And wakes up in a golden room decorated in the
height of Ferengi bad taste and then some.) <br>
QUARK: Where am I? (reads the notice over the door) Please have your
profit and loss statement ready for inspection before entering the
Divine Treasury. I'm dead. Garak, you're good. <br>
(Quark checks the place out during the break.) <br>
QUARK: I'm really dead. <br>
(The door opens and an ancient Ferengi enters. Quark kneels.) <br>
GINT: You're not just dead, Quark. You're an idiot. <br>
QUARK: Who are you? <br>
GINT: I am Gint, the first Grand Nagus. <br>
QUARK: You look like, like my brother, Rom. <br>
GINT: That's because this is a dream, you imbecile. <br>
QUARK: So, I'm not dead. <br>
GINT: What a clever boy. Always thinking. <br>
QUARK: I'm asleep. That explains why this place looks so tacky. I mean,
The Divine Treasury? Please. <br>
GINT: Don't blame me for your limited imagination. Now, I'll make it
simple. You have to break the contract with Brunt. <br>
QUARK: You got to be joking. You're Gint. You wrote the Rules of
Acquisition. The sacred precepts upon which all Ferengi society is
based. You of all people can't expect me to break them. <br>
GINT: Why not? They're just rules. They're written in a book, not
carved in stone. And even if they were in stone, so what? A bunch of us
just made them up. <br>
QUARK: Are you saying they don't matter? <br>
GINT: Of course they matter. That's why they're a best-seller. But
we're talking about your life here. The Rules are nothing but
guideposts, suggestions. <br>
QUARK: Then why call them Rules? <br>
GINT: Would you buy a book called Suggestions of Acquisition? Doesn't
quite have the same ring to it, does it? <br>
QUARK: You mean it was a marketing ploy? <br>
GINT: Shh. A brilliant one. Rule of Acquisition two hundred and thirty
nine. Never be afraid to mislabel a product. <br>
QUARK: I've based my entire life around these rules. How can I just
walk away from them? <br>
GINT: Because I'm telling you to. <br>
QUARK: But you can't do that. You're not Gint. This is just a dream. <br>
GINT: Exactly. And I wouldn't be here if you didn't want to break the
Rules. You just need someone's permission. So I'm giving it to you. <br>
QUARK: I suppose if the First Nagus Gint came to me in a vision and
told me to break the Rules, that would be all right. <br>
BRUNT: Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. <br>
QUARK: What are you doing here? This is a private vision. <br>
BRUNT: I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the
Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. <br>
QUARK: I know, I know. But look. Gint himself has come to me in a
vision. He's telling me to break the contract. <br>
BRUNT: That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that
fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. <br>
GINT: I say we kill him right now. <br>
BRUNT: This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been
known to die in their sleep. <br>
(Brunt starts choking Quark.) <br>
QUARK: Come on, Rom, Gint, whatever your name is. Help me! <br>
GINT: He's got a point, Quark. It's a dream. I can't really do
anything. But if you want to live, break the contract. It's your only
hope.

(Quark comes up and she leaves.) <br>
BRUNT: Come to beg for your life? What is this? <br>
QUARK: I'm returning your five hundred bars of latinum. Plus interest. <br>
BRUNT: I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. <br>
QUARK: I know. I'm breaking the contract. <br>
BRUNT: Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family.
Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed
Ferengis. <br>
QUARK: Look, I've broken the contract, so do your job. Take my assets,
revoke my Ferengi business licence. Do whatever you have to do then get
out. And if I ever see you walk into my bar again <br>
BRUNT: Yes? <br>
QUARK: You won't walk out. <br>
BRUNT: May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this
moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No
Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in
this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! <br>
(Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) <br>
BRUNT: Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. <br>

with you? <br>
ROM: Not bad. <br>
QUARK: Glad to hear it. <br>
ROM: They took everything? <br>
QUARK: Including this shirt. I'm supposed to send it to Brunt in the
morning. <br>
ROM: Don't worry. I have some old clothes I was going to throw out. <br>
QUARK: I'd rather be naked. <br>
ROM: Okay. Brother, the way you stood up to Brunt? Well, I want you to
know that I'm very proud of you. <br>
QUARK: Well, then, I guess throwing my entire life away was worth it. <br>

I don't have a clue. <br>

BASHIR: A case of Alvanian brandy. A patient sent it as payment but I
can't accept it. <br>
QUARK: Nice try, Doctor, but I don't want your charity. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, it's not charity. I find it undrinkable. So do you want it
or shall I dump it? <br>

DAX: Quark. My sister sent me these. (a box of glasses) I thought you
might want them but they're really ugly. <br>

bad brandy and a set of ugly glasses. <br>

ODO: Captain, where do you want me to put all this furniture? <br>
SISKO: We have three levels, Constable. Use them all. <br>
ODO: Understood. <br>
QUARK: Captain, you can't do this! Not without paying a storage fee. A
minimum storage fee. Practically nothing. <br>
SISKO: Send me the bill. <br>
QUARK: All right. Don't just stand there, Odo. Move it all in. <br>
(Morn has already brought a chair and claimed his place at the bar.) <br>
ROM: Look at them, brother. And you thought you had no assets. <br>
QUARK: Sisko, Dax, Bashir, Morn? They're my assets? <br>
ROM: To name a few. <br>
