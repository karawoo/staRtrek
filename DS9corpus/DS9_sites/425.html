BASHIR: Yes, and you're drinking Rokassa juice again, aren't you,
Garak. <br>
GARAK: How did you know? <br>
BASHIR: The odour is unmistakable. <br>
GARAK: So it is. Rokassa juice soothes my nerves. I had a very
demanding customer today. A Bajoran engineer who comes to the shop
constantly just to plague me. <br>
BASHIR: You know, I've always wondered about that. About who your
steady customers really are. I can't imagine Bajorans frequenting a
shop run by a Cardassian. <br>
GARAK: I like to think that my expertise and willingness to serve
overcome any general resentments any of my clientele may have. <br>
BASHIR: Ah. And perhaps your expertise and willingness to serve go so
far as to establish a certain trust between you and your customers? <br>
GARAK: Trust is very important <br>
BASHIR: And once they trust you, they're much more open with you, and
they tell you things. <br>
GARAK: Really, Doctor, must we always play this game? I'm no more a spy
than you are a  <br>
BASHIR: A doctor. <br>
GARAK: I'm afraid you really do allow your imagination to run away with
you. What else can I say to finally convince you that I'm just <br>
BASHIR: Plain, simple Garak? <br>
GARAK: Precisely. <br>
GARAK: Now there's something you don't see every day. <br>
(A Bajoran man and a Cardassian boy have just come out of the airlock
and come straight into the Replimat.) <br>
ZOLAN: Have a seat. I'll get us all some refreshment. <br>
(The boy and Garak look at each other for a long time) <br>
BASHIR: That was odd. Do you know him? <br>
GARAK: On the contrary. I've never seen him before in my life. <br>
(Garak goes over to their table) <br>
GARAK: I hope I'm not intruding, but I couldn't help noticing what a
handsome young man you have here. <br>
(Garak rests his hand on the boy's shoulder, so the lad bites it) <br>
GARAK: Argh! <br>
(Bashir checks Garak's wound while the boy hugs the Bajoran man.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I'm sorry I'm late. The damnedest thing
just happened. Garak the tailor was attacked. <br>
ODO: Attacked? Where? <br>
BASHIR: At the Replimat. He was bitten on the hand. <br>
DAX: Another unsatisfied customer? <br>
O'BRIEN: He always cuts the pants too long. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, it was a boy. A Cardassian boy. <br>
SISKO: I wasn't aware we had any Cardassian children on the station. <br>
ODO: We don't. <br>
BASHIR: He's just arrived on a Bajoran transport with an adult Bajoran
who says he's his father. <br>
KIRA: The boy was probably one of the orphans left behind after the
Cardassians pulled out. We had no choice but to take care of them. You
have an incoming subspace transmission from Cardassia, Commander. It's
Gul Dukat. <br>
SISKO: In my office.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT [on monitor]: Commander, it's been brought to
my attention that the sole Cardassian living on your station has been
assaulted. <br>
SISKO: I'm surprised how quickly the news reached you, Dukat. I only
heard about it myself a minute ago. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Is it true he was attacked by a Cardassian boy
brought to the station by a Bajoran? <br>
SISKO: A Cardassian boy appears to have be involved, yes. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Exactly as I feared. Exactly as I've been warning
my colleagues. <br>
SISKO: Warning them? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: The Cardassian war orphans, Commander. Abandoned
when we left Bajor. It's a disgrace. Obviously these children are being
raised to hate their own kind. This incident is proof. <br>
SISKO: You're assuming a lot from one incident. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Am I? Then why would this boy attack poor Garak? An
amiable fellow, if there ever was one. <br>
SISKO: If you like, I'll try to find out. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: That would be most appreciated, Commander. I need
to find out everything I can about this boy, so that I can use his
story in my fight to bring these orphans back to their homeland. This
is a tragedy that all of Cardassia is going to have to address. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Guest quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PROKA: We didn't come here to cause trouble. Has
this Garak filed a complaint? <br>
SISKO: No, but the Cardassian officials asked that look into the
incident. <br>
PROKA: I wish they'd shown as much concern when they left my boy and
dozens like him to fend for themselves. <br>
SISKO: How did you come to adopt him? <br>
PROKA: My wife and I felt that Rugal shouldn't suffer for crimes
committed by others. <br>
SISKO: But why would he attack another Cardassian? <br>
PROKA: That Cardassian should have minded his own business. <br>
BASHIR: Garak was only trying to be friendly. The boy seemed terrified
of him on sight. <br>
SISKO: The Cardassians are suggesting that the Bajorans are raising
these orphans to hate their own people. <br>
PROKA: To hate Cardassians? It shouldn't be too hard, should it? We
told him the truth, Commander. The truth about what Cardassia did to
Bajor. He needed to know, and for that I make no apologies. To us, he
isn't even one of them anymore. He isn't Cardassian, he's Bajoran. And
we love him just as if he were our own flesh and blood.

come on. Dabo! <br>
QUARK: There's nothing quite so depressing as a winning streak that
won't stop streaking. <br>
ZOLAN: Dabo! <br>
BASHIR: It would appear as if you have this game all figured out. <br>
ZOLAN: Dabo! Dabo is a passion of mine. I remember you. You're Doctor <br>
BASHIR: Bashir. <br>
ZOLAN: Bashir, yes. How's the Cardassian? Still has all his fingers, I
presume? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. Luckily there were no broken bones. I've never seen a boy
take a bite out of a man's hand like that. <br>
ZOLAN: He's a strange boy, Rugal. <br>
BASHIR: Do you know the family well? <br>
ZOLAN: Dabo! <br>
BASHIR: Do you? <br>
ZOLAN: Look, this is really none of my business. <br>
BASHIR: You were a witness. I just want to get my facts right for the
medical report. <br>
ZOLAN: I'd really rather you asked someone else. <br>
BASHIR: Frankly, I don't understand your attitude. All I asked was if
you know them well. <br>
ZOLAN: Well enough. I heard the father was looking for a new job
several months ago and I offered to help. I visited them on Bajor
several times. <br>
BASHIR: Did you find anything troubling? <br>
ZOLAN: It must be torture for that boy living like that. Hated by
people he thinks of as his parents. Told day after day that he's
worthless Cardassian scum. Beaten if he even looks the wrong way. Rugal
is their revenge. Their revenge against all Cardassians.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PROKA: It is not true. It is not true. Rugal will
tell you. We have not mistreated him. Is this some Cardassian? <br>
SISKO: There'll be ample opportunity to go over the matter in detail,
but during the investigation, we'd like for Rugal to stay with our
schoolteacher, Mrs O'Brien. She's expecting him now. <br>
PROKA: What if I refuse? <br>
SISKO: Then I'll have to call Security and have them remove him from
your quarters. I don't think either of us wants that. <br>
(Proka goes into the next room) <br>
RUGAL [OC]: Why? <br>
PROKA [OC]: It'll be all right <br>
RUGAL [OC]: I didn't do anything wrong! <br>
PROKA [OC]: I know. I know. It'll be all right. I promise. <br>
RUGAL: I didn't do anything wrong. <br>
SISKO: Nobody's accusing you of a crime, Rugal. You're not being
arrested. My name is Commander Sisko. I believe you already know Doctor
Bashir. <br>
BASHIR: Hello, Rugal. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure all of this will be straightened out in a day or two.
If you want to visit with your father tomorrow, you can. <br>
PROKA: Go on, Rugal. We'll talk tomorrow. They won't hurt you. They're
humans, not Cardassians.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Actually, something good did come out of
all of this, Garak. <br>
GARAK: Oh? <br>
BASHIR: If it hadn't happened, we never would have discovered Rugal's
situation. And a bite on the hand is certainly worth saving a boy's
life, wouldn't you say? <br>
GARAK: I suppose it depends on whose hand. Just joking, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Perhaps it might even help Gul Dukat in his efforts to resolve
the entire war orphan predicament. <br>
GARAK: I beg your pardon? <br>
BASHIR: Gul Dukat. He called Commander Sisko right after this happened.
Apparently he was quite concerned with your well-being. You never
mentioned you were friends. <br>
GARAK: (laughs) You said Dukat is doing something about war orphans? <br>
BASHIR: He wants to bring them all home from Bajor. <br>
GARAK: Does he. <br>
BASHIR: Am I missing something? <br>
GARAK: Tell me, Doctor. Is there a single trait would you ascribe to me
and to my fellow Cardassians? Would it not be our attention to detail?
Do you think we simply forgot about those poor little orphans when we
left Bajor? Do you think they simply slipped from our minds? And who
would you guess was in charge of the Cardassian withdrawal from Bajor?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I don't know how to thank
you. <br>
SISKO: Don't thank me too quickly, Dukat. The boy could be returned to
his adoptive parents. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: After the accusations this businessman has made.
<br>
SISKO: That's all it is for the moment. An accusation. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: We would not take kindly to the boy being
returned to the Bajorans. However, I have complete confidence in your
ability to be thorough, Commander. And if there's anything I can do. <br>
SISKO: As a matter of fact, there is. If it is decided the boy should
be returned to Cardassia, to
whom would we return him? It might help to find out if he still has any
living relatives. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I was going to suggest that you forward us a
sample of the boy's DNA and we'll run it through our data banks
immediately. <br>
SISKO: We'll send it right away. <br>
BASHIR: Excuse me, Gul Dukat. I have a question. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Doctor Bashir, isn't it? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. Isn't it true you were in charge of the evacuation of
Bajor? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Yes, I was. <br>
BASHIR: Then it would have been your responsibility to ensure that
these orphans were in fact part of that evacuation, yet you chose to
leave them behind. Why? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I did not choose to leave them behind, Doctor. I
was ordered to leave them behind. <br>
BASHIR: Ordered? By whom? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: By the civilian leaders. They <br>
BASHIR: Excuse me, but if I understand the Cardassian political system
correctly, the civilian leaders have no direct authority over military
officers. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Who's been tutoring you in Cardassian social
studies, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Your old friend, Garak. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Well then, perhaps you should remind my old
friend Garak the withdrawal of Bajor was a decision made by the
civilian leaders. One that I clearly opposed. And yes, they made the
decision to leave the orphans behind. A decision I've regretted ever
since. Thank you for your concern, Doctor. Good day, Commander. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
BASHIR: He's lying. <br>
SISKO: Is that an opinion, or do you have evidence to support it? <br>
BASHIR: I have Garak. <br>
SISKO: Garak. <br>
BASHIR: He seems to think there's more going on here than we realise. <br>
SISKO: What exactly does he think is going on? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not sure. He doesn't actually tell me what he really
thinks. I sort of have to deduce it. <br>
SISKO: So, you deduced that Garak thinks Dukat is lying about something
you're not sure of and you proceeded to interrupt my conversation to
confront him about whatever that may be. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, Commander. It just seemed an opportune <br>
SISKO: Don't apologise. It's been the high point of my day. Don't do it
again. <br>
DAX: Why would Garak want to undermine Gul Dukat? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not really sure. I don't think he likes Dukat very much. <br>
SISKO: I'd like to ask Garak about this myself. Have him in my office
at twenty one hundred hours. <br>

O'BRIEN: Well, you can't judge a whole race of people. You can't hate
all Cardassians or all Klingons or all humans. I've met some
Cardassians I didn't like, and I've met some I did. Like you. <br>

Commander, but thanks to the DNA gene type you sent us, we've
discovered the boy's actually the son of one of our most prominent
politicians, Kotan Pa'Dar. <br>
SISKO: When was Pa'Dar on Bajor? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Over eight years ago. He was Exarch for a
Cardassian settlement there. The boy was believed to have died in a
Bajoran terrorist attack. <br>
SISKO: Has he been told his son is alive? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Of course. As you can imagine, he's overwhelmed
with joy. He's already on his way to the station to reclaim him. <br>
SISKO: It's not that simple. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I don't understand. <br>
SISKO: The boy wants to go back to Bajor. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Back&gt; To live with the same brutal people? <br>
SISKO: I can't find any evidence to support that accusation. I can't
even find the man who made it in the first place. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Nevertheless, when the boy finds out his real
father's alive, surely he'll change his mind. And even if he doesn't,
it would be in the boy's best interests. <br>

out. <br>

about Pa'Dar before he woke me up. What could he be looking for on

They've taught many worlds, including this one, how to keep records. I
find it difficult to believe that none exist from that time period.
Certainly computer entries made on a regular basis. <br>

GARAK: And isn't it interesting that one of Cardassia's most notable
civilian leaders has recently entered this scenario. <br>
BASHIR: Rugal's father? You're saying Kotan Pa'Dar was involved in the
decision to evacuate Bajor? <br>
GARAK: Very good, Doctor. I'm glad to see our little get-togethers
haven't gone for naught. <br>
BASHIR: Which makes him a political enemy of Gul Dukat's. Who lost his
job as Prefect when they withdrew. <br>
GARAK: And seemingly out of nowhere, Dukat takes an interest in this
orphan boy who recently arrives on our station. And then soon
afterwards, with Gul Dukat's assistance, we discover that the orphan
boy isn't really an orphan boy, but Pa'Dar's long lost son. <br>
BASHIR: Another coincidence? <br>
GARAK: I believe in coincidences. Coincidences happen every day. But I
don't trust coincidences.

O'BRIEN: Miles O'Brien. Come in. Sit down. <br>
PA'DAR: Where is my son? <br>
O'BRIEN: He's with my wife. They'll be back shortly. I thought it might
be a good idea if we talked first. Your son, Rugal <br>
PA'DAR: At least they didn't change his name. <br>
O'BRIEN: When was the last time you saw him? <br>
PA'DAR: On Bajor. He had just had his fourth birthday. He probably
doesn't even remember me. Does he? <br>
O'BRIEN: I think he's spent most of his life trying to forget you. <br>
PA'DAR: I don't think I understand. <br>
O'BRIEN: The boy hates everything he is. He hates Cardassians, he hates
being a Cardassian. <br>
PA'DAR: Yes, I've heard those stories. Well, I suppose after growing up
among the Bajorans. But now that I'm back in his life. <br>
O'BRIEN: He may not want you back in his life. <br>
PA'DAR: I am his father. Mister O'Brien, I know very little about human
culture. I don't know how you view the family. <br>
O'BRIEN: We'd do almost anything to protect our families. I have a
daughter myself. She's four, the same age your son was when you lost
him. <br>
PA'DAR: Then I expect you can imagine what I'm feeling right now. On
Cardassia, family is everything. We care for our parents and children
with equal devotion. In some households, four generations eat at the
same table. Family is everything. And I have failed in my
responsibilities to my family. <br>
O'BRIEN: You had no way of knowing he was still alive. <br>
PA'DAR: I should have tried harder. I should have looked everywhere. To
abandon my son, to allow him to be raised a Bajoran. I have disgraced
that everything a Cardassian believes in. <br>
(Keiko enters, followed by a reluctant Rugal) <br>
PA'DAR: Hello, Rugal. Do you remember my face? Even a little? <br>
RUGAL: No. <br>
PA'DAR: Would you like to see some pictures of you when you were a
child? <br>
RUGAL: No. <br>
PA'DAR: Rugal, you have to understand. There was nothing left of the
house after the attack. Your mother was dead and you. I cried for you,
Rugal. I missed you so much. I could not even stay on Bajor. It was too
close to the happy memories of you. <br>
RUGAL: It was your own fault. You deserved it. You are Cardassian. What
the Bajorans did, they had to do. <br>
PA'DAR: I understand why you say that. <br>
RUGAL: You can't understand. You are a Cardassian butcher! A butcher.
They killed your son for your crimes. <br>
PA'DAR: Rugal. <br>
RUGAL: You are not my father! And I will never go back to Cardassia.
Never.

PROKA: You gave up custody when you abandoned him here. <br>
PA'DAR: He is my natural born child. As Cardassian law clearly
stipulates <br>
PROKA: There is no more Cardassian law on Bajor <br>
SISKO: Gentlemen, I think you may need an arbitrator to settle this. <br>
PROKA: It must be someone who is neither a Cardassian nor a Bajoran.
What about you? <br>
SISKO: I'd be willing, but wouldn't you have objections because of the
Federation's relationship with Bajor? <br>
PA'DAR: No, Commander. You are a father too. You would be acceptable to
me. <br>
SISKO: Very well then. I'll schedule a <br>

arrived on the station. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Station log, stardate 47177.2. The arrival of Gul
Dukat only powers my suspicion that we are being manipulated in some
unseen manner. Doctor Bashir and Garak continue to search for anything

custody hearing. <br>
DUKAT: Pa'Dar is an eminent member of the civilian assembly. This
matter has generated a great deal of interest at the highest levels of
our government. <br>
SISKO: So, you're here representing your government? <br>
DUKAT: Not exactly. I like to think that I'm here representing the
children. All of the children abandoned on Bajor. I want to see Rugal
reunited with his father. <br>
SISKO: Well, I'm sure Pa'Dar is grateful for your support because I was
under the impression that you were political adversaries. Isn't that
so, Pa'Dar? <br>
PA'DAR: We have disagreed in the past, but Commander, I don't see <br>
DUKAT: And I must object, Commander. The past is the past. It has no
relevance here. What is relevant are the children. What are we going to
do about the children? <br>
SISKO: If you don't mind, I'd like for you to go over the events
leading up to the disappearance of Rugal eight years ago. </font></p>

searching seven thousand, four hundred and twenty files for a
misspelling. <br>
GARAK: Dukat is much smarter than that. <br>
BASHIR: Than what? <br>
GARAK: Think about it, Doctor. He would never have left a file to be
found. <br>
BASHIR: Do you really think he purged the file on Rugal? <br>
GARAK: I would have. <br>
BASHIR: There was something in that file he didn't want anybody to see.
<br>
GARAK: Exactly. We have one last chance, to find the person who wrote
that file in the first place. <br>
BASHIR: How do you ever hope to find him? <br>
GARAK: Her. <br>

BASHIR: You do? <br>
JOMAT [on monitor]: He was the only Cardassian boy we had at the time.
We had several girls. <br>
BASHIR: Are you sure his name was Rugal? <br>
JOMAT [on monitor]: That's what we were told. <br>
BASHIR: Somebody told you his name? <br>
JOMAT [on monitor]: Yes, that was the most unusual thing about his
arrival. Virtually all of the other Cardassian children turned in to us
were found on the streets by Bajorans. Rugal was brought in by a
Cardassian. <br>
BASHIR: A Cardassian military officer, by any chance? <br>
JOMAT [on monitor]: Yes, as a matter of fact, she was. <br>
BASHIR: A woman? <br>
JOMAT [on monitor]: I don't remember her name, but she was attached to
the command post at Terok Nor. Is there anything else, Doctor?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: The boy accused him of being a butcher. He
hates Cardassians, sir. Pa'Dar was heartbroken. I can only imagine how
I'd feel in his shoes. <br>
(Bashir and Garak enter) <br>
BASHIR: Commander, can I ask O'Brien a few questions? Chief, didn't
Pa'Dar tell you about the humiliation he feels right now? <br>
O'BRIEN: He said he had disgraced everything a Cardassian believes in. <br>
BASHIR: Has the news of your son's discovery become public knowledge on
Cardassia? <br>
PA'DAR: The government has not chosen to reveal it to the people yet. <br>
BASHIR: What happens when it is revealed? <br>
PA'DAR: It will be the end of my political career. <br>
BASHIR: That's a shame. Especially considering the timing. <br>
PA'DAR: The timing? <br>
BASHIR: Isn't there an inquiry about to begin concerning the
Cardassians who were involved in the attempted military coup on Bajor? <br>
PA'DAR: Yes. <br>
BASHIR: And isn't Gul Dukat one of the key witnesses in that inquiry? <br>
DUKAT: This is irrelevant and insulting. Commander, you've lost control
here. <br>
SISKO: Yes, it seems that I have. <br>
DUKAT: I suggest we return to the issue of the children. <br>
BASHIR: All right, let's talk about children. Have you ever been to the
Tozhat Resettlement Centre on Bajor where Rugal was adopted? <br>
DUKAT: Never. <br>
BASHIR: Of course, Tozhat is the province where Pa'Dar was stationed
eight years ago. <br>
DUKAT: I'm aware of that. <br>
BASHIR: I've been trying to find records of Rugal's adoption, but
they're missing from the files. <br>
DUKAT: How unfortunate. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, but we have found someone who was working at the centre at
the time Rugal was brought in. Do you know a Bajoran social volunteer
named Jomat Luson? <br>
DUKAT: No. <br>
BASHIR: Jomat Luson remembers Rugal being brought in by a Cardassian
military officer. A woman who seemed familiar with him. Even knew his
name. <br>
DUKAT: Is there a question? <br>
BASHIR: The question is whether or not this officer deliberately left
the son of Kotan Pa'Dar at the Relocation Centre with full knowledge
that he was not an orphan. Perhaps even with the hopes of humiliating
Pa'Dar someday. <br>
DUKAT: I wouldn't know. <br>
BASHIR: Would you happen to know then of a base known during the
occupation as Terok Nor? <br>
DUKAT: Terok Nor? It was here. This space station. <br>
BASHIR: Jomat Luson clearly recalls that the officer who brought in
Rugal was attached to Terok Nor. <br>
(Dukat looks Garak right in the eyes and heads for the door) <br>
BASHIR: Gul Dukat! Who was the commanding office at Terok Nor eight
years ago? <br>
(Dukat leaves) <br>
BASHIR: For the record, the commanding office of Terok Nor eight years
ago was Gul Dukat.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Station log, stardate 47178.3. After long and
difficult deliberations, I have decided to allow Pa'Dar to take his son

conspiracy. I believe it's time for his healing to begin.

I certainly won't choose to discuss them. <br>
SISKO: A stalemate. <br>
PA'DAR: A stalemate. You've helped me salvage my political career. I
won't forget that. <br>

GARAK: Truth, Doctor, is in the eye of the beholder. I never tell the
truth because I don't believe there is such a thing. That's why I
prefer the straight line simplicity of cutting cloth. <br>
